roxanne jones: beyonce gets super bowl show right

february 9

""there were nods to michael jackson, to black greek step shows, to malcolm x and a salute to the 50th anniversary of the founding of the black panthers. for a minute, watching beyonce and those strong black women sporting black berets and big afros march out onto the field, i forgot i was watching a super bowl performance. for the first time i felt like i wasn't just a spectator of the game but that the game had become a part of my black experience in america. with just a few lyrics, beyonce connected with black women everywhere. her performance became personal.""

david axelrod: a surprising request from justice scalia

february 14

""justice david souter, scalia's longtime colleague on the court, had just announced his retirement, creating a vacancy for president obama to fill. scalia figured that as senior adviser to the new president, i might have some influence on the decision -- or at least enough to pass along a message.

'i have no illusions that your man will nominate someone who shares my orientation,' said scalia, then in his 23rd year as the court's leading and most provocative conservative voice. 'but i hope he sends us someone smart.'

a little taken aback that he was engaging me on the subject, i searched for the right answer, and lamely offered one that signaled my slight discomfort with the topic. 'i'm sure he will, justice scalia.'

he wasn't done. leaning forward, as if to share a confidential thought, he tried again.

'let me put a finer point on it,' the justice said, in a lower, purposeful tone of voice, his eyes fixed on mine. 'i hope he sends us elena kagan.'""

jay parini: why the hate for hillary clinton?

jay parini

march 20

""her achievements in congress and at the state department can't be denied, though many will try. don't forget her courageous china speech on the rights of women, her aggressive work on climate change and her skill as a senator in guiding the children's health insurance program through congress. she helped to negotiate a ceasefire with hamas during a tense moment in israel. i think of her successes in forging alliances in south america, africa and asia, and her part in establishing tough sanctions against iran. that's only the beginning.

and yet people hate her. her negative ratings, in fact, have been shockingly high for someone this close to the nomination of her party. indeed, one of the most frequently posed questions to the candidate herself is some version of 'why don't they like you?'

of course, republicans have known for a long time that hillary clinton is an unusually strong candidate, and this terrifies them. so they have seized on talking points like benghazi (for which she bears little or no responsibility) and her email scandal. on the latter, even columnist ruth marcus -- certainly no fan of clinton's -- recently wrote in the washington post that 'there is no clear evidence that clinton knew (or even should have known) that the material in her emails was classified.' as we've seen, neither benghazi nor the email trouble are likely to put off democratic voters, who regard them as republican talking points.""

danny cevallos: abby wambach's arrest for a crime that makes no sense

danny cevallos

april 4

""why? why do people who otherwise would never commit a crime somehow get arrested for drunken driving? sure, it's a question of personal responsibility, but why is it so much easier for upstanding citizens to refrain from all other crimes, except dui?

it's the mixed signals. most other criminal activity unambiguously violates our social norms. there's no 'gray area' when it comes to smoking meth at a cocktail party, for example. most crimes are also social faux pas, such that you would neither engage in, nor tolerate the behavior from a peer.

with duis, however, there are mixed messages. most people are surprised to learn that it's not actually illegal to drink and drive. technically, it's only illegal to drive while 'impaired' by alcohol. what does 'impaired' mean?""

stephanie coontz: the awkward truth of 'make america great again'

stephanie coontz

april 29

""idealizing the era when america was the economic powerhouse of the world, bipartisanship reigned and male breadwinner families were the norm requires overlooking much else. nostalgia is never random. we cherry-pick the past, highlighting what we like and leaving out the things we don't, even if they were closely intertwined.

so when trump says let's ""make america great again"" and clinton says let's make it 'whole again,' they neglect to mention how much the prosperity of the postwar era depended on a system of regulation and taxation that neither of them shows any inclination to reinstate.""

august 2

""as 16 republican primary opponents failed to stop trump's momentum, the idea that he is crazy seemed to miss the mark. the word ""crazy"" conjures up a person who is so plagued by delusions, or perhaps hallucinations, that he makes no sense at all.

consider his success, both before and during his pursuit of the presidency, and it's hard to argue that trump suffers from such a profoundly distorted view of reality.

in fact he has long demonstrated a keen awareness of how our society worships celebrity and rewards those who can attract the limelight and hold its focus.""

peter bergen: bin laden's spectacular miscalculation

peter bergen

september 8

""for so long the two great oceans of the atlantic and the pacific had protected america from its enemies, but no more.

yet, for all their tactical success the 9/11 attacks failed strategically and, in the end, achieved precisely the opposite of what osama bin laden had intended.

there are, of course, differences between the post-world war ii era and the post 9/11 era. the long-term aftermath of pearl harbor was not only a decisive allied victory in the war but also decades of american leadership and dominance.

after its initial success in afghanistan following 9/11, victory was not decisive for the united states. instead, american forces continued to be at war with a number of shadowy jihadist groups, most recently isis, and this now seems like a quasi-permanent state of affairs that could persist well beyond the next presidency.""

september 27

david gergen: ""by all traditional standards of debate, mrs. clinton crushed. she carefully marshaled her arguments and facts and then sent them into battle with a smile. she rolled out a long list of indictments against donald trump, often damaging. by contrast, he came in unprepared, had nothing fresh to say, and increasingly gave way to rants. as the evening ended, the media buried him in criticisms.

even so, i doubt she has put him away.""

s.e. cupp: ""in contrast, trump mostly did the job he had to do. to move undecideds, he had to hammer one point home: clinton is a politician who doesn't get it. over and over again, he attacked her as more of the same, out of touch, and a politician who hasn't gotten it right. he didn't go after her character or personal issues, for the most part -- which voters know well. she outmanned him on specifics and details. but his attacks were far more effective than hers.""

october 16

""[trump's] message was clear: mock me, and i might sue you.

couple all this with trump's calls during this campaign to change the libel laws to make it easier for him to sue media outlets who unfairly criticize him, and this is no laughing matter.

would a president trump use the apparatus of the federal government -- such as the federal communications commission -- to intimidate comedians and dissuade them from mocking him? yes, i know we have a first amendment, but alarmingly i bet there are trump supporters who would go along with anything trump asks for, even if it was flat out unconstitutional.

(cnn) in my house, we called it going boneless. that's when my girls, as toddlers, would arch their backs, screaming uncontrollably, usually in a public place (of course!) and there was nothing my husband or i could do to satisfy them.

if you have kids and you've experienced one of their meltdowns, you no doubt know what i mean and what it feels like at that moment, when you are a mixture of emotions -- embarrassed, frustrated, angry and completely at a loss for how to resolve the problem. even bribery, which we know is never the way to go, doesn't seem to work when your child is at wit's end and unable to calm down.

we recently asked some parents to act out what their children do and say when they melt down as part of a new cnn digital video series called ""parent acts."" since we know parents tend to get the best advice and support from other parents, we thought it would be fun and helpful for parents to act out what their kids are doing when there is a problem, and then have a parenting expert listen to their role play and weigh in with advice.

pauline hilborn, a mom of two in new york city, describes herself as an expert on meltdowns based on the experiences of her daughter, who she says is ""7-years-old but sounds more like 13.""

case in point: hilborn's daughter wanted a ponytail like the pop singer ariana grande, but felt like her mom didn't do the ponytail properly and put it in the wrong place.

""she came out crying and said, 'ariana grande's ponytail is here not here,'"" said hilborn, pointing to the place on her head where her daughter preferred the ponytail to go, not where it ended up.

pauline hilborn and her kids, ages 4 and 7.

""i was at a loss for words,"" she said. ""i had no idea what to say but my husband said, 'well, she's right you know,' which didn't help the situation.""

debi, another mother of two in manhattan, says her 7-year-old has definitely had some tantrums. when i asked her son what a meltdown is, he told me it's when you cry a lot. when i asked him to imitate one, he said he keeps screaming until his mom lets him have whatever it is that he wants at that moment.

""i completely freeze in those situations,"" she said. ""i lose all rational sense of now what do i do ... i don't know how to do it without bribing him, so i end up taking away things.""

help is on the way

family therapist tricia ferrara is author of ""parenting 2.0.""

ferrara listened to our parent volunteers imitate exactly what their children do and say during a meltdown, and then offered her advice:

no. 1 -- try to prevent it

yes, you can actually prevent a meltdown, said ferrara, a mom of two teens. kids get tired and hungry, and then they can't tell you what's going on. ""you want to try and maybe not bring a child to places that trigger them,"" and avoid outings at the end of the day when it's still difficult for them to coordinate their emotions with their body, she said. (i wish i had this in mind that time i decided to take my kids, then 2 and 4, grocery shopping right before dinner time. not a smart move.)

no. 2 -- disregard what other people think

while it may be hard to do, we need to forget about the other people watching us during those cringe-worthy moments when our kids are yelling at the top of their lungs and people are definitely noticing. ""i always say to parents ... you've got to stop, drop and do what you have to do,"" she said. ""escalating back to the child is not helping anything, because that's more sensory information that is going to make them go nuclear."" think of yourself as a ""tuning fork,"" said ferrara. ""the calmer and clearer you can be, the better things will go.""

no. 3 -- create a small upside for them

adults sometimes have to look for creative ways to maintain authority, and eliciting small concessions from your child can go a long way, said ferrara. ""create one bit of upside even if it's, 'you take one breath and we count to three together [then] we can get you want you want, and then we'll go home,' she explained. ""what that does is it keeps you in control and as the authority in the situation.""

no. 4 -- don't leave home without a strategy

the ""biggest mistake"" parents make is they go into situations ""without a strategy,"" said ferrara. ""do you go to the hair dresser without a plan? a business meeting? go buy a car? no, but we always allow ourselves to fall into these potholes with our kids with no plan,"" she said.

remember debi, the mom who said her son sometimes has meltdowns when he can't get what he wants? ferrara said before heading out or going anywhere, she could tell her son that how he behaves is going to determine whether he could do something else, such as play with his birthday presents that evening.

""and so when he starts to behave in a way that is not acceptable to you, instead of getting into the verbal joust with him, you can say, 'do you want to play with your birthday presents?' you can remain clear and calm and communicate in a way that he understands,"" said ferrara to debi. ""if you rock back a bit and anticipate a little more and be a little more strategic, you might get better results from him,"" she said. ""and after consistency, he's going to know, 'oh it's a new day.'""

no. 5 -- help children convey how they feel

when the body is flailing, that often means the language is not working, said ferrara. for example, in the case of hilborn, the mom who's daughter melted down after the ponytail disaster, ferrara said she could have said to her daughter, ""honey, if you need help, say it. say 'mom, i need help changing the ponytail.' that language helps her organize herself.""

""you want your child to have an expectation of things, but she can't beat up on other people to get there, and certainly you can't stand in for that,"" ferrara said to hilborn. ""so what you want to do is teach her to say, 'i need help. i want this changed,' and then you can move in a more functional way.""

the amateur country crooner sang pro-trump ditties while strumming a guitar emblazoned with trump campaign stickers, earning him the moniker ""trump troubadour.""

but now, moss refuses to play the guitar with the trump decorations. he's soured on the president because of the newly proposed republican health care bill.

that legislation, which the president supports, could result in dramatic cuts in addiction treatment services.

three years ago, moss found his son, rob, dead in his bed from a heroin overdose. he was 24.

""the bill is an absolute betrayal of what trump represented on the campaign trail,"" he said. ""i feel betrayed.""

moss feels it personally.

last year, at a campaign rally in iowa, trump reached out and spoke directly to moss about rob's death.

""in all fairness to your son, it's a tough thing. some very, very strong people have not been able to get off (heroin),"" trump called out to moss in the crowd. ""the biggest thing we can do in honor of your son ... we have to be able to stop it.""

when moss became emotional, trump comforted him.

""i know what you went through. and he's a great father. i can see it. and your son is proud of you. your son is proud of you,"" trump said. ""i'll bet he was a great boy.""

kraig moss, a supporter of donald trump during the campaign, sings a song outside a truck with a trump painting last year in iowa. now, he regrets doing so.

several times on the campaign trail, trump vowed to increase services for people facing addiction.

""we will help all of those people so seriously addicted. we'll get them assistance,"" he told the crowd at a campaign event in new hampshire in october.

moss trusted trump.

""i truly believe from the heart that (trump) is going to do everything he can. he's going to create treatment centers for the kids,"" he said last year.

but last week, moss read about the proposed american health care act. the republican bill would end the obamacare requirement that addiction services and mental health treatment be covered under medicaid in the 31 states that expanded the health care program -- which include moss' home state of new york.

""this bill would devastate efforts to address the opioid crisis,"" said dr. joshua sharfstein, director of the bloomberg american health initiative at johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health. ""there's no question this legislation in the house of representatives would cost american lives.""

, health and human services secretary tom price was asked about the bill's provisions for opioid treatment. at a cnn town hall event last weekhealth and human services secretary tom price was asked about the bill's provisions for opioid treatment.

he responded that state governors had ""wonderful ideas about how to address it"" but that they felt ""hamstrung by the federal government.""

""there are wonderful ways if we keep the focus on the patient -- not the government, but on the patient,"" he said.

moss looks back on his days on the campaign trail, on how he sold his trucks to finance the trip, how he sang his heart out and went from restaurant to restaurant to hand out ""donald trump for president"" cds.

they may appear morbid by today's standards, but at the turn of the 16th century, they were the height of fashion: palm-sized ivory carvings of skulls, mirrored by human faces, that represent status, wealth and the looming specter of death.

commonly referred to as ""memento mori,"" the objects take their name from a latin phrase (meaning ""remember you must die"") that informed popular thinking during the late middle ages and early renaissance. they were collected by social elites -- from upwardly mobile merchants to europe's most powerful monarchs -- across france, germany, belgium and the netherlands.

institutions from around the world, including london's victoria and albert museum and the metropolitan museum of art in new york, have contributed examples of the carvings to an impressive collection now being exhibited at the bowdoin college museum of art in brunswick, maine.

stephen perkinson, an associate professor of art history at bowdoin college and the guest curator of ""the ivory mirror: the art of mortality in renaissance europe,"" describes the 15 carvings on display as ""miniature masterpieces.""

""they have a basic message, which is the memento mori message: to remind the viewer that we are all mortal and that, in the end, death equalizes all of us,"" he said in a phone interview. ""what's interesting about these objects (though) is that the theme doesn't explain their intricacy, their complexity, their interest.""

a sign of wealth

although the 15th and early 16th centuries -- when most of these pieces were made -- were times of relative social and political stability, ivory memento mori were part of a larger cultural moment that emphasized humility, reflection and moral obligation. traveling preachers would deliver sermons on mortality to peasants in paris cemeteries, the working class would buy prints on the theme (some of which feature in ""the ivory mirror"") and the rich had their ivory carvings.

""in a lot of respects, people (were) living better then,"" perkinson said. ""so in some ways, these things are not so much responses to the fragility of life, but rather the comforts that people are feeling, and a way of saying, 'don't get too caught up in the ways in which your life is better than what your grandparents experienced.'

""they're a response to the fact that people might (have been getting) distracted from their faith, from their moral duties. they might be distracted into obsessing over luxury goods and treasures instead of remembering the fragility of life.""

an ivory chaplet (c. 1530) made in france or the southern netherlands credit: courtesy victoria and albert museum

on examination, it seems inevitable -- if ironic -- that the ivory devotionals would become the very luxury items they were designed to warn against. the use of ivory suggests long-distance trade and a taste for the exotic, while the surprising anatomical correctness (which perkinson says reflects ""information about the structure of bone that was cutting-edge knowledge in their day"") would have been appealing to collectors looking to show off their worldliness and wealth -- the way an alligator-strap, swiss-crafted watch might do today.

transcending religion

but the metaphor of the anonymous skull, stripped of all markers of identity, was pervasive, and could be taken as a comfort or warning, depending on your status.

""at the time, people were very fixated on this idea that your individual identity is conveyed through your face and your appearance -- your costume, your heraldry and your insignia of office ... (so) that message that, in the end, everybody is indistinguishable and the same on some level, social differences are erased, is a pretty powerful one,"" perkinson said.

while this message reinforced the christian sentiments of the time, perkinson believes that memento mori transcend religion, tapping into fundamental questions about morality and forcing people to think about their actions on earth. even if we don't discuss death as openly or plainly today, this preoccupation remains, he said.

""one of the interesting things about this exhibition is that we've had people come through from all different faith traditions (and) we've had people who don't have any particular faith tradition,"" perkinson said.

exactly one year ago, donald trump's shocking performance on election night sent shudders through global markets. dow futures crashed by nearly 900 points as investors fretted about trump's volatility and scary campaign promises on trade and immigration.

""it was fear and panic that night,"" said wade balliet, chief investment strategist at bank of the west.

but the market freakout vanished by morning, and stocks started the trump era on a decidedly optimistic note.

""people quickly decided maybe it's not doomsday. maybe it's an opportunity,"" balliet said.

it turned out to be an historic opportunity.

the s&p 500 has soared 21% since the close of trading on election day 2016. that's the third-best performance during a president's first year since world war ii, behind only president george h. w. bush and president john f. kennedy, according to sam stovall of cfra research.

the stock market also hit a record number of records under trump. the s&p 500's 60 all-time highs since the election is unmatched during a president's first year in office, according to cfra.

that achievement underscores the fact that trump inherited a stock market near all-time highs and an economy that was in solid shape. it also highlights how remarkably tranquil the rally has been. sharp drops and steep gains have been rare.

related: trump tax cuts could create boom -- then a bust

unlike most of his predecessors, trump frequently brags about wall street's post-election rise. it's a tactic that could backfire should stocks tumble, as they've been known to do at times.

trump went a step further by recently appearing to take full credit for the market's climb.

""the reason our stock market is so successful is because of me,"" he told reporters on air force one on monday.

trump, who has filed for several business bankruptcies, added, ""i've always been great with money, i've always been great with jobs, that's what i do.""

it's true that the initial party on wall street was driven by optimism about trump's pro-business promises: slashing corporate taxes, ripping up regulation and ramping up infrastructure spending.

but that wasn't the only driver. stocks continued to rise, even as trump's legislative agenda stalled, thanks to impressive corporate profits and a strengthening economy at home and abroad.

in a recent survey by e*trade, 61% of investors listed the improving u.s. economy as a factor driving the bull market in stocks. just 32% gave credit to trump and his administration.

some even think that if trump lost, we could be talking about the hillary rally right now, thanks to a goldilocks backdrop of low unemployment and even lower interest rates.

""regardless of if it was clinton or trump, we would be looking at similar market performance this year,"" said balliet. instead of tax cuts, he said wall street would be focused on infrastructure spending under clinton.

related: janet yellen leaving on a high note

but the real question is: where do stocks go from here?

the economy and corporate profits will need to continue growing at a healthy clip to justify how pricey stocks have gotten. the s&p 500 has rarely been as expensive as it is right now, according to goldman sachs.

jpmorgan chase predicted this week that the s&p 500 will barely rise at all next year -- just 3.3% -- due to these lofty valuations.

for now, wall street will obsessively focus on the fate of the gop tax overhaul. failure would likely disappoint investors, potentially sparking a rare selloff. if trump succeeds in getting ""massive"" tax cuts, the stock market may celebrate.

of course, it's an open question whether the u.s. economy really needs huge tax cuts right now. unemployment is sitting at just 4.1%, after all.

the risk is that adding expensive medicine to an already-healthy economy overheats the stock market.

were it not for the courageous voices speaking out publicly in the last two weeks, there would be less accountability for sexual misconduct. THIS IS A GLOBAL NEWS","johnita p. due is vice president and assistant general counsel for cnn. the opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.

(cnn) the movement empowering women to speak up publicly about sexual misconduct against them has been spreading like wildfire across the media and entertainment industries -- and beyond. we've seen the effects this week with public accusations of sexual harassment being made against a hollywood director, a celebrity chef, a political journalist and even a former president.

many are hopeful that the voices speaking up will, finally, break the culture of acceptance, turning a blind eye and silence about sexual harassment and assault in our society. there is often a fear that speaking up will lead to some sort of retaliation by the accused, with accusers' reputations at stake. that is why there is often strength in numbers, and as more women speak up and say #metoo, the more that men in positions of power or authority over women will be held accountable.

but a massachusetts federal appellate court ruling last week dismissing a defamation case against bill cosby seems dissonant with this growing movement. as a result of the case, women whose characters are maligned by the men they publicly accuse of sexual misconduct could face a great hurdle if they bring defamation actions to restore their reputations. based on the ruling, raising their voices in the media might force them to meet a higher burden in order to prevail in court.

this particular case involved kathrine mckee, a former actress and now casting agent, who alleged in a new york daily news interview on december 22, 2014, that cosby raped her in a hotel room in 1974. she revealed the alleged rape after more than 20 other women had already come forward with their own accusations of sexual assault.

the same day then-cosby attorney martin singer emailed the daily news a letter rebutting the allegations made by mckee and the other accusers, rebuking the paper for publishing this ""never-before-heard tale"" and for ignoring or failing to investigate what he called ""evidence undermining [mckee's] reliability"" -- which he listed in bullet points with numerous accompanying footnotes, including links to articles.

although the singer letter was marked with the words ""confidential legal notice"" and ""publication or dissemination is prohibited,"" mckee alleged that it was leaked to the media by the cosby camp. the letter was reported on by news media covering the cosby controversy. mckee sued cosby for defamation on the basis of the statements in the letter.

""mckee came forward after more than twenty other women had levelled [sic] highly publicized sexual assault accusations against cosby, who in response allegedly hired a team of lawyers and investigators 'to discredit them, to intimidate them, and to intimidate any future would-be accusers.'""

however, the judge found that the very act of speaking up publicly against cosby made mckee a public figure for the purposes of her defamation action, i.e. a ""limited purpose"" public figure:

""by purposefully disclosing to the public her own rape accusation against cosby via an interview with a reporter, mckee 'thrust herself to the 'forefront' of this controversy, seeking to 'influence its outcome.'"" (citing us supreme court case gertz v. robert welch, inc.)

in other words, mckee would have to meet the highest standard in a defamation case -- the actual malice standard -- which the us supreme court has reserved for public officials and figures.

this actual malice standard requires that a plaintiff who is classified as a public figure in a defamation action must show that a defendant knew the things s/he was saying were false or s/he had a reckless disregard for the truth.

in contrast, a private figure would only have to prove that the defendant acted negligently in making false statements about her, i.e. by not exercising reasonable care to determine if the statements were false. it is much harder to prove actual malice (knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth) than negligence.

the appellate judge determined that mckee had failed to meet that burden. in affirming the lower court's decision to dismiss mckee's defamation case against cosby, the court ruled that most of the statements made in singer's letter constituted his opinion, which was not actionable under defamation law, and to the extent the statements in the letter were not considered opinion, mckee, as a limited purpose public figure, had failed to meet that higher actual malice standard required of public figures.

as the harvey weinstein controversy has made painfully evident, even high-profile celebrities and entertainers -- who would normally be classified as public figures anyway in defamation actions -- have been fearful about sharing their stories of sexual harassment, assault and rape.

this ruling could greatly impact all of the lesser-known individuals across industries, normally private figures, who have to make a difficult decision: stay silent, or speak up against sexual misconduct and risk attacks on their character that they may not be able to vindicate in defamation actions because of the higher burden they must meet.

the mckee decision is only the latest ruling in the defamation cases against bill cosby by his accusers. some courts have ruled in favor of other accusers and denied cosby's motion to dismiss, finding that a november 21, 2014, statement by the cosby attorney implying that the accusers' allegations were completely fabricated was not protected opinion, and that the accusers should be considered private figures at that stage of the litigation. (ironically, the judge who ruled against cosby in that case had ruled in favor of cosby in the mckee case).

and in a case stemming from the same november 21, 2014, cosby attorney statement, another court granted cosby's motion to dismiss, based on the protected opinion defense, without addressing the question of whether the accuser should be considered a public or private figure.

these inconsistent rulings in the defamation cases against cosby make it difficult to predict whether sexual misconduct victims will always be classified as public figures simply because they've spoken up to give public accounts of the crimes against them. but they should be aware of that real possibility, based on the mckee decision.

of course, nobody deserves to be falsely accused of sexual misconduct, and anyone publicly accused of sexual misconduct deserves the right to publicly defend themselves. both cosby and weinstein have consistently denied all allegations of nonconsensual sexual conduct. false accusers could exist, even when there are allegations by dozens of women spanning decades.

however, if in response to such allegations, the accused are permitted to make false statements about their accusers to discredit their reputations and succeed in getting defamation lawsuits dismissed simply because the accusers have been brave enough to publicly reveal the sexual misconduct, women (and men) may be dissuaded from speaking up.

were it not for the courageous voices speaking out publicly in the last two weeks, there would be less accountability for sexual misconduct. yes, women should report allegations to human resources, the eeoc and law enforcement authorities where possible, but it is the media they have used to galvanize a movement.

despite the mckee court ruling, the editorial in the new york times v. sullivan, the case which established the actual malice standard during the civil rights movement, reminds us that we must ""heed their rising voices, for they will be heard.""

melendez says medication his mother took for morning sickness may have kept his arms from developing.

as a child, he knew he was different but never felt like an outcast.

""did people make fun of me? yes,"" melendez recalled. ""but it was always in the background for me. that's their problem, not mine.""

he credits family for his confidence and ability to thrive.

""there were four of us: two brothers and two sisters. there were times that they didn't want to help me. there were times that it was not super easy, but as a family, we started working together and kind of learned how to help each other.""

melendez tried artificial arms at age 6. he maneuvered them well. but after a few years, the spirited boy realized he could do just as much without the prosthetics.

""i just felt they (artificial arms) were too heavy,"" melendez said.

he was able to do much more with his feet and his mouth.

melendez finds music through ministry

""at first, my dream was to become a priest,"" melendez said. ""i always had kind of that ministry heart. i wanted to help others."" however, at that time, priests were generally required to have thumbs and index fingers to give communion.

""i didn't have the hand. i didn't have the arm."" melendez realized he would have to go a different direction.

he was 16 years old when another musician showed him how to tune the guitar differently. that's when he realized he could use his toes to strum the chords.

""people would come to the house and ask who's playing the guitar, you know. my family would have to walk them in the bedroom and say 'tony's playing.' and then they would believe it,"" he said. ""music became another way i can serve others.""

a kiss from the pope

melendez recalls his 1987 performance for pope john paul ii as a ""moment i will never forget.""

""i got a letter in the mail asking me to come to the diocese,"" he said. ""i showed up thinking i would be a part of a large choir."" he soon found out that it was an audition to perform for the pope.

light bursts into the dark room through a horizontal slit and an intersecting vertical line.

in the simple pews behind the mesmerizing cross-shaped glow, scores of visitors snap pictures on their phones of the concrete installation.

they are inside a life-sized replica of the church of the light, the famous osaka chapel by japanese architect tadao ando, which perfectly demonstrates his signature manipulation of the relationship between concrete, space and light.

inside, its solemnity is breathtaking. carving a cruciform into a reinforced concrete wall evokes such a pure feeling of spirituality it seems ludicrous it hadn't been done before 1989.

but that's the beauty of an ando design. ""(my work) seems like something which anyone can make,"" he tells cnn. ""but (nobody) else can make it. it is my architecture.""

the national art center, tokyo has erected the structure on its terrace for its huge retrospective of ando life's work that runs until december 18.

in english, the show is called ""endeavors,"" but in japanese, the name translates more accurately as ""challenge"" -- a title that speaks not only to ando's personal struggles but also to the inherent problem of exhibiting the work of an architect.

the installation is a powerful reply to that problem, but ando says the real point of the exhibition is to inspire people to ""go and see the real ones.""

boxing clever

ando is a household name in japan, and his celebrity is expected to attract 150,000 visitors to the exhibition, many from beyond the architecture world.

""everybody can enjoy ando's work,"" says yayoi motohashi, curator of ""endeavors."" ""and his biography is really encouraging. he didn't have enough money to get an education. he did everything himself.""

ando's unlikely rise from obscurity to design some of the world's most iconic buildings for its richest people is something of an urban legend.

the self-taught japanese architect was born in 1941 the eldest of twin boys, who were separated in their infancy. ando went to live with his grandmother, who nurtured in him a talent for craftsmanship.

his younger years had no trace of great promise: he worked briefly as a professional boxer and a lorry driver, before aged 24 boarding a siberian train to europe ""to see the world.""

swiss-born french architect charles edouard jeanneret, aka le corbusier, was a major influence on ando. credit: felix man/hulton archive/getty images

great buildings caught his eye, in particular, the works of le corbusier -- the swiss-french purist whose concrete designs later inspired ando's own. the japanese architect famously named his pet dog corbusier.

after he sailed back to his native of osaka, without a degree or having trained with a master, ando got his architecture license and starting designing buildings.

back then, he was known as the ""urban guerrilla"" architect.

from tiny homes with gaping internal courtyards to sprawling housing complexes, and then churches that seemed as much a hymn to his own style as to the spiritual realm, by 1995 ando's concrete vision had conquered the architectural world, and he was awarded its highest accolade: the pritzker prize.

""his life and his works inspire,"" says motohashi. ""that's why this exhibition is called 'endeavors.' people in japan don't try to do big things, they don't want to make a mistake or have a really huge dream.

""that's the message to society: be free to strike out.""

home truths

ando made his breakthrough in 1976 with a windowless reinforced concrete home.

slotted between three traditional japanese houses, the row house in sumiyoshi is a reclusive stronghold fed natural light only by its interior courtyard. it challenged conventional ideas of the home, and won ando an award from the japan association of architecture, but was it comfortable to inhabit?

the current owner, who has lived there for 35 years, says: ""while feeling the seasonal changes on my skin (in) the courtyard every day, sometimes i resent this house. sometimes i get excited about living here, and sometimes this house challenges me ... (but) i have never become bored of all the experiences.""

sometimes i resent this house. sometimes i get excited about living here, and sometimes this house challenges me. owner of the row house, in sumiyoshi

interviews with residents of ando homes willing to sacrifice some comfort to be closer to nature, for greater privacy, to be challenged by design, are peppered throughout the hall of the show dedicated to a wide spectrum of the architect's residential projects, from humble early homes to the sprawling rokko housing complex in kobe.

""even though tadao ando does huge projects, he still believes that houses are the fundamental part of his work,"" explains motohashi. she adds that ando -- who was heavily involved in shaping the exhibition -- wanted to stress that architecture is the product of a relationship between a client, construction firm and architect, and that the ""architect is not the greatest"" party in that alliance.

ando's reputation grew throughout the 1980s, and by the early '90s well-known figures were seeking out his talents. in 1992, the benetton fashion family enlisted him to design their invisible house, near venice, a concrete home sunk 13 feet below ground for privacy.

elsewhere, ando was experimenting with windows and embracing nature. the 4x4 house in kobe is located on a coastline suffering from severe erosion. planning permission had been granted on a ""postage stamp-sized"" piece of land, and on it, ando built a four-story tower with an almost entirely glass facade that optimized views of the seto inland sea but left the structure exposed to the elements.

""ando told me that it would be tough when a typhoon comes,"" says the owner of 4x4. ""certainly, i don't feel (safe) when a typhoon is close. however, since i got used to it, i enjoy living in this house. (it) is not susceptible to fashion, and has a richness i would not change ... this will be the place where i will live till the end of my life.""

the bigger picture

no man is an island, but some men can transform one.

in the mid-1980s, ando was part of an extraordinary project on naoshima island, which was experiencing population decline as the mitsubishi metals processing plant that its economy relied on slowed down. japanese billionaire soichiro fukutake, of the benesse corporation, had the vision to turn the island into a cultural hub, and commissioned ando to design the benesse house museum. the art gallery was partially buried into the earth, as had become an ando trademark, and artists were invited to make works for this unique location.

it sparked a trend. in the following decade, ando built six more public buildings there, abandoned homes were turned into guesthouses, japanese artist yayoi kusama famously installed one of her polka dot pumpkins at the end of a pier, and naoshima's triennial arts festival now brings about 800,000 tourists to the island each year.

artchitecture transformed naoshima's fate.

a giant illuminated model of the island is the centerpiece of the exhibition's central hall, a vast, light-bathed space showcasing the big projects of ando's 50-year career.

one of these works is the hill of the buddha: a 13.5 meter-tall sculpture which had been erected in sapporo, hokkaido, 15 years before ando arrived. his brief was to build something that would draw attention to the religious sculpture.

so he buried it. today, the buddha sits inside a manmade concrete hill covered in lavender, the top of its head just visible. the buddha is accessible to visitors through a 40-meter tunnel. a time-lapse of its creation is projected onto a white wall, transfixing visitors.

other areas of the main space are dedicated to ando's foray into updating existing structures. in 2009, he inserted geometric forms inside the punta della dogana in venice, to transform the 15th century building into an art museum at the behest of french luxury goods tycoon françois pinault.

and there is also room in this great hall of success to talk about failure.

pictures of his rejected 1995 proposal for the tate modern in london reveal an ethereal idea to suspend a glass rectangle from the original redbrick bankside power station. his unrealized 1989 plan for osaka public hall, meanwhile, would have inserted an egg-shaped room into the middle of the neo-renaissance structure, perhaps an idea ahead of its time.

you should respect old people, you should respect old buildings. at the same time, you should look to the future. tadao ando, architect

it is a recurring theme that when ando encounters an existing architecture, he builds around it or within it, but never takes away from the original.

he explains: ""you should respect old people, you should respect old buildings.

""at the same time, you should look to the future.""

endeavors ahead

ando is now 76 years old, but his endeavors and challenges are not over. in 2012, he developed aggressive cancer and had to have several of his organs removed. he recovered from the illness and appears in good shape.

earlier this year, he announced a 108 million euro ($121 million) plan, also financed by pinault, to insert a giant concrete cylinder into a 19th century, domed structure that was once home to the parisian stock exchange. it will house some of pinault's private art collection.

and, of course, ando has just launched the biggest ever celebration of his own work.

signing autographs for those buying ""endeavors"" the exhibition catalogue in the gallery gift shop, ando seems in good spirits -- something we had been warned isn't always the case. he is wrapping up when a final fan approaches, a tall caucasian man wearing tight black jeans.

he introduces himself to ando. ""hello, i'm paul smith,"" he says.

""the paul smith?"" my translator asks me. ""the paul smith,"" he replies to us.

ando becomes alert. the renowned british fashion designer is at his exhibition, and queuing for an autograph.

as the luminaries swap business cards, ando teases him: ""i already have a job.""

after smith leaves, ando turns to us, flamboyance tingling through him, eye contact truly being made for the first time.

""in 40 years, i have never once marketed myself,"" he declares proudly, puffing his chest forward, a little smile dancing around his lips.

""​tom ford. karl lagerfeld,"" he says, listing the designers he's created homes for. ""they all come to me.""

and that's it. his people lean in to whisk him away, and tadao ando departs from the retrospective of his life's work looking like a very satisfied man. THIS IS A GLOBAL NEWS",tadao ando: how japanese architect became the king of concrete

THIS IS A GLOBAL NEWS","(cnn) emory healthcare in atlanta is moving toward a resolution with a family whose child is in need of a kidney transplant. the hospital drew the ire of activists when it delayed the operation after the father, the organ donor, was arrested several days before the surgery.

two-year-old aj burgess, who was born without working kidneys, according to a family attorney, has been called a ""miracle child.""

he weighs only 25 pounds, according to cnn affiliate wgcl , and has required constant medical attention.

""he's my pride and joy, my sunshine,"" said aj's mother, carmellia burgess, on hln. ""he's made me humble.""

but little aj is in need of a kidney transplant, according to his parents.

""i love him,"" burgess said tearfully. ""and i guess i just hate to see him going through this.""

his father, anthony dickerson, was found to be a perfect match and volunteered to donate one of his kidneys after complying with an extensive evaluation required for living donors, according to the family's attorney, mawuli davis.

emory healthcare in atlanta was set to remove dickerson's kidney on october 3, according to davis, and soon after, aj would undergo the transplant at children's healthcare of atlanta at egleston.

but on september 28, dickerson was arrested for a parole violation, davis told cnn, for allegedly being in possession of a firearm while fleeing and eluding police. after five days, dickerson was released, and all set to undergo surgery the next day.

hospital refused to perform surgery on father

the surgery didn't go as planned.

""on october the 3rd, when they arrived, they were informed they would not be able to do the transplant,"" said davis. it wasn't until the next day the family was told that because dickerson had been arrested, he would need to provide the hospital with proof of complying with his parole for 90 days -- effectively postponing aj's transplant until january.

""at that time, they could not believe what they were hearing,"" davis said.

initially, emory healthcare wouldn't elaborate to media on dickerson's situation, saying ""guidelines for organ transplantation are designed to maximize the chance of success for organ recipients and minimize risk for living donors. transplant decisions regarding donors are made based on many medical, social, and psychological factors,"" wgcl reported.

after meeting thursday with the family, emory healthcare apologized for a breakdown in communication. it said is meeting with the family on monday to discuss to further review the matter.

in a statement sent to cnn on saturday, dr. jonathan lewin, ceo of emory healthcare, said the ""entire emory community is motivated and engaged to help him [aj] secure a healthy future.""

""we greatly respect the father's desire to become a donor, and we want to work with him to try and make this happen,"" lewin said. ""the national guidelines for approving a potential organ donor are clear and stringent. when evaluating any potential donor, emory's medical team is required to consider the ability of the donor to manage the many complications and health challenges that come with a major surgical procedure.""

according to davis, emory's justification for denying the transplant was that the hospital wanted to be sure dickerson would be in a position after the procedure to adhere to the after-care requirements for living donors.

""everybody understands that,"" davis told cnn, ""but nobody can make any guarantee about what happens to a donor when a donation is made.""

davis added, ""his parole probation status should not, as far as we're concerned, be a factor at all.""

""i don't see why they think it would be a problem for me to try to treat myself after i do the transplant,"" dickerson said on hln, adding that he would do everything the hospital required.

emory had previously concluded dickerson ""would comply with any and all after-care requirements,"" according to harold spence, another family attorney.

hospital apologizes, meeting with family

davis says the hospital did not effectively communicate with the family for nearly a month.

but emory appeared to be open to moving forward this week, davis said, after activists from emory's candler school of theology began protesting the hospital's decision and demanded a meeting with officials on thursday.

one of the activists contacted the attorneys and had them bring the family to the meeting, which was ""the first communication of any kind,"" davis said. ""we were unable to get a sit-down meeting with emory until the tactics used by these activists yesterday.""

on friday, davis called the meeting the ""first positive step forward,"" but said there was still a long road ahead.

aj's parents expressed thanks for support.

""i just want to thank the community,"" burgess said. ""if it wasn't for y'all, we wouldn't be closer to the transplant, so thank you.""

the 2-year-old is currently fighting an infection at children's healthcare and underwent surgery on friday to change the way aj received dialysis.

""we have said from the very beginning that this is a difficult situation,"" davis said. ""but what this mother knows and what we all know was that this child is a miracle child."" THIS IS A GLOBAL NEWS","toddler's family, hospital to meet over denied kidney transplant"

in a new observational study involving close to 20,000 individuals, people who consumed at least four cups of coffee daily had a 64% lower risk of early death compared to those never or rarely consumed coffee.

the reduction in risk was more significant once people reached the age of 45, suggesting that it may be even more beneficial to consume coffee as we get older.

these findings echo the recent results of another large observational study, which found that coffee drinkers appear to live longer , regardless of whether they consume regular or decaf coffee.

coffee has also been shown to reduce the risk of many diseases, including type 2 diabetes, liver disease, colorectal cancer, alzheimer's and skin cancer, too.

""coffee is loaded with antioxidants,"" said joe derupo, a spokesman for the national coffee association. ""many are naturally occurring antioxidants found in the coffee bean, while others are created during the roasting process. it's these compounds that science links with positive effects in reducing the risk of several diseases.""

some of the compounds commonly found in coffee ""have been related to better insulin sensitivity, liver function and reduced chronic inflammation,"" said v. wendy setiawan, an associate professor of preventive medicine at the keck school of medicine of usc, and the lead author of one of the recent studies on coffee consumption and longevity.

cup of caution

while coffee consumption may appear to be healthful for many, others should proceed with caution. pregnant women, for example, should cautiously limit their intake of caffeinated coffee.

""current evidence suggests that consuming moderate amounts of caffeine up to 200 mg per day, the amount in a 12-ounce cup of coffee, is not associated with increased risks for miscarriage or preterm birth,"" said dr. joseph wax, chair of the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists' committee on obstetric practice. ""however, data are contradictory regarding these pregnancy outcomes when women consume more than 200 mg per day of caffeine."" additionally, ""there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusion regarding the effects of caffeine on fetal growth.""

if you have any heart conditions, you should also limit your coffee and caffeine consumption. ""caffeine is an aggravator and accelerator of one's heart rate,"" said dr. vince bufalino, a spokesman for the american heart association and senior vice president and senior medical director of cardiology-amg, advocate health care, in naperville, illinois. ""those with atrial fibrillation (commonly known as irregular heartbeat) or hypertension should limit their caffeine intake. one to two cups daily is probably fine, but if you are sensitive, you should restrict all caffeine.""

keep in mind that decaffeinated coffee still contains caffeine. an 8-ounce cup of brewed coffee can contain anywhere from 75 to 165 milligrams of caffeine, whereas decaffeinated coffee contains an average of 2 to 7 milligrams per cup, depending on which study you read.

""decaf is not 'no-caf' -- so if you are drinking three cups of decaf per day, then i would restrict that,"" bufalino said of people with heart conditions.

as for coffee's effects on bone health, caffeine in coffee can lead to calcium loss, but it is probably not worth worrying about. ""caffeine does increase urinary calcium loss, but it is balanced by increased calcium absorption so there seems to be no adverse effects on the calcium economy,"" said connie weaver, distinguished professor of nutrition science at purdue university, who recently led a review of the research on calcium and bone health

women are having children at an older age, when the chance of fertility is lower, experts say

(cnn) the us fertility rate has dropped to the lowest number reported since fertility records started being kept more than a century ago. there were 61.5 births per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44 in the year ending the first quarter of 2017, according to numbers released by the national center for health statistics on tuesday.

this demonstrates a further decline from the previous year; at the same point in 2016 , the rate was 62.5 births per 1,000 women. the report states the shift from last year to this year is significant, meaning the difference is more than experts would expect mere chance to produce, said brady hamilton, a statistician-demographer with the center and an expert on fertility data.

the general fertility rate gives an idea of how many children are being born into the population during a specific period, he said. these numbers can be monitored to assess levels of reproduction within a population over time.

""when it comes to births, it tells us about future members of society that will go on to replace the current work force and will be generating revenues and so on,"" hamilton said. ""so this information allows you to see how the united states has changed demographically. it allows you to see where you currently stand.""

thus, for many military families, showing disrespect for the flag, the national anthem or other american symbols can come as a slap in the face.

""i stand for our flag and anthem, and i kneel for our fallen. that's what patriots do,"" said keith harman, a vietnam combat veteran who leads the 1.7 million-member veterans of foreign wars of the united states. ""we rally around the flag of our country, not use it and our constitution as both shield and sword.""

honoring the us military has become part of the pageantry of nfl games, from jet flyovers to enormous american flags unfurled on playing fields. indeed, the pentagon has spent millions of dollars on ""paid patriotism"" displays at sporting events, a 2015 report found.

people wave flags on september 11, 2017, along an overpass near melvern, kansas.

but some wonder whether other groups of americans should also be afforded the same kind of tributes.

""wrapping yourself in the flag and honoring the military is something which no one is going to object to. we all respect their sacrifice. we all honor their sacrifice,"" sportscaster bob costas told cnn this week. ""and yet what it has come to mean is that the flag is primarily and only about the military.

""this is no disrespect to the military. it's a huge part of the narrative. but martin luther king was a patriot. susan b. anthony was a patriot. dissidents are patriots. schoolteachers and social workers are patriots.""

also often welling with patriotism are immigrants.

many of these newcomers fled poverty, violence or oppression in their native countries, and so they have special appreciation for the freedoms other americans might take for granted.

immigrants take the oath during a naturalization ceremony on september 15 in new jersey.

just go to a naturalization ceremony, where eyes well with tears as oaths of allegiance are sworn by newly minted us citizens.

""i'm very excited,"" ahmed el-mallah told cnn at one such ceremony in new jersey in february, five years after he arrived from egypt. ""i'm very lucky to be here today.""

patriotism is partisan

it used to be simpler. during world war ii, we were all patriots. decades later, we swelled with national pride when our country somehow landed two men on the moon.

and in the tender weeks after september 11, 2001, we bonded through our shared anger and grief. we flew flags, sang ""god bless america"" and vowed to defend our way of life -- rock 'n' roll, fast food and all -- against all enemies. when pollsters asked americans last year to name the time in their lives when they felt most proud of their country, the top answer was during the national response to 9/11

but that spirit waned as our country's political climate grew more partisan, fueled by echo chambers in the media and on the internet. and a ""patriotism gap"" grew between our major political parties.

a man pauses on september 11, 2015, at the ohio statehouse lawn in columbus to memorialize victims of the 9/11 attacks.

gallup polls revealed that democrats were consistently less likely than republicans to feel ""extremely"" or ""very"" proud to be americans.

when barack obama became a presidential candidate in 2007, many questioned his muted expressions of patriotism. that october, obama took heat after a reporter in iowa noticed he wasn't wearing an american flag lapel pin. ""i'm less concerned about what you're wearing on your lapel than what's in your heart,"" obama said then . but by the time he accepted the democratic nomination in august 2008, a flag pin adorned his suit jacket.

last week, president donald trump inserted himself into the debate when he said the nfl protests are a ""total disrespect of our heritage, a total disrespect of everything that we stand for.""

""if a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the nfl, or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect our great american flag (or country) and should stand for the national anthem,"" he tweeted . ""if not, you're fired. find something else to do!""

president donald trump speaks on september 22 at a rally in alabama.

patriotism is nuanced

last year, only 52% of american adults told gallup they were ""extremely proud"" of their country, the lowest number in 16 years

many people revere the ideals the united states represents -- freedom, equality, opportunity -- but complain bitterly about washington in the tradition of the late american writer edward abbey , who once wrote, ""a patriot must always be ready to defend his country against his government.""

america appears to be moving toward a more nuanced form of patriotism.

audrey birnbaum young is a green bay packers fan, who like thousands of others has shares in the league's only publicly owned franchise. she has friends who played in the nfl and family members who served in the military.

""there's a lot of other ways [to protest] without offending the veterans of our country,"" she said.

but, she added, ""if you ask any one of those players how they feel about the service men and women that have defended our country. i guarantee you not one of them would disrespect our service men and women.""

attendees stand for the pledge ahead of the president's visit at a march 20 event in kentucky

patriotism is complicated

last sunday in detroit, retired army lt. col. leonard rusher was honored by the lions during the second half of their game against the atlanta falcons. while some lions kneeled during the playing of the national anthem, rusher saluted the flag.

asked about the protests that have spread throughout the nfl, rusher, who is black, expressed mixed emotions.

""i understand why they are kneeling. that's what i fought for, for them to have the right. personally, i don't like it. but i appreciate that what they are doing is a non-violent protest,"" he told the detroit free press

""i'm saddened because the flag means so much, all the opportunities we have and that i'm grateful for,"" rusher said. ""but (the players) are expressing what that flag stands for -- equal opportunity, equal justice, equal liberty. that's what they are fighting for.""

nate boyer, a former us army green beret who briefly played pro football, wants people to consider both sides of the anthem-protest debate.

the national anthem is played before an nfl game in arizona in november 2015.

""i want colin kaepernick and every american to stand because they want to stand,"" boyer said wednesday during a cnn town hall on the issue. ""i'm more interested if someone's taking a knee because they really care about something than the guy in the stands or the girl in the stands ... (who) feels obligated to stand up when the anthem is played, because that's how i used to be before i served.""

nobody knows how long the expressions of protest at nfl games will go on, or what effect they may ultimately have. many fans, focused on football, probably wish they would go away.

but as long as they continue, the kneeling and the players' locked arms offer glimpses of american democracy in all its unruly glory. they sustain a debate. and there may be something patriotic in that.

""aerial fine art photography attracts me because it is one of the most challenging types of photography,"" prensena tells cnn travel.

so for them, under the house bill, state and local taxes could be treated as a business expense on their personal return. THIS IS A GLOBAL NEWS","house republicans want to kill the state and local income tax deduction. but apparently not for everyone.

their tax reform bill, being debated this week by the ways and means committee, would repeal the federal tax deduction that people get for paying state and local income taxes, and it would curb how much they can deduct in property taxes.

the tax break known as the salt deduction is one of the most controversial revenue raisers because it is near and dear to taxpayers -- and lawmakers -- from highly taxed areas across the country. today, just under 30% of filers claim the state and local tax deduction on their federal returns, according to the government finance officers association.

but tax experts have spotted what appears to be a big exception to the repeal: the owners, shareholders and investors in so-called pass-through businesses would still be allowed to deduct their state and local taxes in full.

the provision allows the deduction if the state and local taxes are ""paid or accrued in carrying on a trade or a business ... [or on expenses related to] production of income.""

as for everyone else who currently takes the salt deduction? sorry, charlie, no can do.

related: what's in the house republican tax bill for businesses

pass-throughs make up the majority of u.s. businesses. they take the form of sole proprietorships, llcs or s corps. and those with an ownership stake in them pay taxes on the entity's profits on their individual returns.

so for them, under the house bill, state and local taxes could be treated as a business expense on their personal return. that would include president trump, who typically structures his businesses as pass-throughs.

but ordinary employees of such businesses would still be barred from taking the deduction against their wages.

a spokesperson for the house ways and means committee confirmed to cnnmoney that ""all"" pass-through owners and investors ""will continue to be able to deduct state and local taxes incurred in the conduct of a trade or business.""

but the provision as written raises big questions for tax policy watchers.

a key one is whether professional service firms, which are often set up as pass-throughs, would qualify for the salt deduction. professional services include firms providing financial services, legal services and consulting.

the salt provision in the house bill doesn't explicitly say they're not eligible and the word from ways and means is that ""all"" pass-throughs could take the deduction.

but -- and this is where it gets tricky -- another provision in the house bill flatly precludes professional service pass-throughs from taking advantage of the proposed new 25% rate on pass-through profits.

related from cnn: some republicans say fight isn't over for popular deduction

when asked about this at a house ways and means hearing monday, thomas barthold, chief of staff at the joint committee on taxation, seemed to indicate professional service providers -- such as partners in a big law firm -- likely would not be allowed to deduct their state and local taxes because all their income would be taxed as ordinary income, and would not receive the special 25% pass-through profits rate.

but other experts disagreed.

""there's nothing in the legislation providing that. [a professional services firm] is still a trade or business that's a pass-through,"" said new york university tax law professor david kamin, who formerly served as a special assistant to president obama for economic policy.

when asked to settle the issue, a spokesperson for ways and means wasn't immediately available for comment.

kamin believes the exception to the repeal -- if that's what the tax writers truly intended -- would result ""in deep unfairness and plenty of gaming.""

the teenager needed dialysis treatments for his failing kidneys. but instead of aid, deivis contracted a deadly bacterial infection called sepsis at a children's hospital in venezuela, a nation grappling with severe shortages of medicine and proper equipment amid a wider array of crises.

the water that the hospital used for deivis' dialysis machine wasn't properly kept and filtered, doctors say, allowing bacteria to enter his bloodstream.

deivis lost 22 pounds in his first two months in the hospital after starting his dialysis treatment. an ulcer in his throat made it too painful to eat solid food. a severe outbreak of dark spots covered his upper body, which created a burning sensation. his 14-year-old body shrank to that of a 7- or 8-year old.

when cnn met with deivis and his mother, sandra galindez, in late july, he cried and buried his head in his hands.

""i want everyone to see what's happening with us here. it's not just what you're seeing on tv: the protests, the clashes. we are in the hospital suffering,"" said galindez, a single mother with two other young adult children.

galindez gave up her job to take care of deivis. he couldn't sleep through most nights, so she often got only three to four hours rest at a time.

deivis suffered for three more weeks before dying the night of august 17 after going into respiratory shock.

after his death, galindez was overwhelmed with ""sadness, anger, an enormous emptiness in my heart, in my soul.""

""it really hurts knowing that you bring your son (to the hospital) for one thing, he gets worse from others, then you get him back in a box,"" she said.

deivis perez's 14-year-old body shrank to that of younger child.

venezuela is in its own crisis. skyrocketing inflation has created extreme shortages of food, medicine and other essentials. a political crisis peaked in july when president nicolas maduro replaced the opposition-controlled legislature with an entirely new legislature filled only with his supporters. several governments, including that of the united states, have labeled maduro's regime a dictatorship.

deivis was one of eight children to die this year just in the dialysis ward at the public children's hospital. last year, only three children died in the dialysis unit at hospital de niños j.m. de los rios in caracas.

deivis wasn't the only child infected by the bacterial outbreak in the dialysis unit at this hospital. at least four children died as a direct result of the infection, according to the head of the nephrology unit, dr. belen arteaga. the other four died from complications related to their renal illness.

the quality of the care deivis received is a point of contention between arteaga and galindez. arteaga says that the hospital isolated the infected children and stopped the outbreak's spread and that deivis' bacterial infection was stabilized. she says the hospital had blood for a transfusion to give him and even had the right catheter. but the hospital didn't have a functioning operating room where the catheter could be replaced. arteaga noted that deivis' body didn't respond well to the transfusions he received early in his hospital stay.

after his death, deivis' mother felt ""an enormous emptiness in my heart, in my soul.""

galindez blames the hospital and venezuela's health ministry, which oversees public hospitals. she says neither did anything as she alerted hospital staff that deivis' condition was deteriorating.

venezuela's health ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

arteaga acknowledges that the hospital lacks even the basics: gloves, masks, antibiotics and resources for certain operations, such as replacing a catheter for a blood transfusion.

most of its medicines and supplies come from foreign nongovernmental organizations and foundations.

venezuela's health ministry hasn't responded to many of the hospital's requests for supplies, arteaga says.

""if we don't offer everything that they truly need to get better, the mortality rate will undoubtedly go up,"" she said. ""we don't even have emergency surgical rooms.""

galindez says she found a matching kidney for deivis last summer. but it was a futile search: kidney replacements for children haven't happened since april because the hospital doesn't have the resources to perform the operation. functional filters for dialysis machines are also hard to come by.

sadly, deivis' death is one of many in venezuela's spiraling humanitarian crisis. malaria cases soared to 240,000 in 2016, a 76% increase over 2015, according to a rare release in may of records from the health ministry.

that's telling: venezuela eradicated malaria in its most populated states by 1961, according to the world health organization.

maternal deaths in venezuela rose 66% last year to 756. infant deaths shot up to 11,466, a 30% jump.

maduro has both rejected foreign aid and called for medical relief, though the situation on the ground shows no signs of changing. some outside experts speculate that if the government accepted the aid, it would be acknowledging that it can't solve its crises on its own.

what galindez would say to maduro after losing her son: ""resolve all the crises in the country -- and if he doesn't feel prepared to do that, then simply hand over power."" THIS IS A GLOBAL NEWS",venezuela: a child's life cut short amid country's crisis

THIS IS A GLOBAL NEWS","there is no olympics and no us presidential election in 2017, so we’ve added some new questions this year. where will donald trump visit first as president? who will win the nobel peace prize? check out the predictions for these questions and more:

how did they do? cnn legal analyst paul callan deserves a special shout out for being the only person to predict both a donald trump election victory and that the chicago cubs would win the world series, although the strong performance of the dow jones index in 2016 took all our contributors by surprise.

about this time last year, we asked a group of cnn commentators for their predictions for some of the big political and cultural events of the year.

paul callan cnn legal analyst @paulcallan which country will donald trump visit first as president? trump will travel to the one country on earth that will warmly welcome the new us president while americans cheer as well: israel. he is respected there for his pro-israel and anti-iranian foreign policy positions. daughter ivanka’s conversion to the jewish faith won’t hurt, either. which team will win the super bowl? the patriots will win again, this time using fully inflated footballs. which movie will win the oscar for best picture? martin scorsese’s 28-year “passion project” silence, a film about the japanese roman catholic rebellion against the tokugawa shogunate in 17th century japan will win the oscar for best picture. who will win the men’s final at wimbledon? who will win the women’s final? great britain’s andy murray will once again win the men’s final while germany’s angelique kerber will win the woman’s title. who will win the world series? chicago cubs do it again with their strong, young team. who will win the nobel peace prize in 2017? the nobel peace prize will be awarded to german chancellor angela merkel for her humanitarian efforts regarding europe’s growing muslim refugee crisis. what will be the closing level for the dow jones on the last day of 2017? the dow will hit 22,000 as lower taxes and fewer government regulations stimulate a growing and vibrant us economy. sadly, air quality diminishes as fossil fuel use skyrockets with the acquiescence of the epa. what will donald trump’s approval rating be in gallup’s final survey of 2017? while presidential approval ratings are generally high during the first “honeymoon year,” constant controversies will prevent trump from ever getting a traditional honeymoon. he will, nevertheless, achieve a high 55% approval rating as the us economy improves in 2017 because in the words of james carville: it’s “the economy, stupid.”

danny cevallos cnn legal analyst @cevalloslaw which country will donald trump visit first as president? traditionally, the first state visit is to canada…but how likely is donald trump to feel bound to tradition? he’s already been to mexico and met with president enrique peña nieto -- a country everyone believed he’d long ago alienated. so, although it sounds unbelievable, maybe…the philippines? which team will win the super bowl? the new england patriots -- because america loves a dynasty. doesn’t it? america? hello? which movie will win the oscar for best picture? ""manchester by the sea""! everyone’s already said it’s going to win the oscar and i haven’t the foggiest idea what it is even about yet. the majority is clearly behind this film and the majority vote is always right, right? hello? who will win the men’s final at wimbledon? who will win the women’s final? wimbledon? ummm. i’ll say that guy murray. and a williams? a williams will win the women’s final. who will win the nobel peace prize in 2017? based on the buzz right now...""manchester by the sea"". who will win the world series? as insufferable as all my chicago friends have been, the cubbies will win the series again. what will be the closing level for the dow jones on the last day of 2017? my “lockzilla” prediction is 19,500. what will donald trump’s approval rating be in gallup’s final survey of 2017? i’m going to say 35%, but then again, predicting the predictability of polls is…unpredictable.

frida ghitis cnn opinion contributor @fridaghitis which country will donald trump visit first as president? donald trump likes to make brazen, unpredictable moves. a visit to china would fit the bill. he has been needling beijing, with provocative statements that undercut decades of us policy. in beijing he could present his demands to the chinese and discuss what he expects them to do about the growing threat from china’s friend, north korea’s kim jong-un. which team will win the super bowl? the new england patriots. still, don’t bet on politics staying out of the game, or out of lady gaga’s halftime show, a reminder that political tensions will be hard to escape in 2017. which movie will win the oscar for best picture? the winner will be “lion,” an astonishing story of survival, with elements that can provide a sense of pride and optimism to people of different ethnicities and economic conditions. who will win the men’s final at wimbledon? who will win the women’s final? serena williams will win the women’s final, and instead of debating whether she is the best female athlete of all time, the sports world will ask if she is the best athlete of all time. the men’s title will go to novak djokovic. who will win the world series? the experts said trump had as much of a chance of becoming president as the chicago cubs had of winning the world series. they both won. i say the cubs win again. who will win the nobel peace prize in 2017? syria’s white helmets. it will be a gesture from an international community rightly ashamed over its failure to stop the carnage. what will be the closing level for the dow jones on the last day of 2017? the markets will climb during trump’s first year in office, as he launches a massive government spending infrastructure plan. the dow jones will close 21,800. what will donald trump’s approval rating be in gallup’s final survey of 2017? 34%. backers will support him passionately, but most americans will feel revulsion watching blatant conflicts of interest and mounting scandals plaguing the trump administration, openly calling for the president’s impeachment.

peniel joseph cnn opinion contributor @penieljoseph which country will donald trump visit first as president? president trump’s first visit abroad will be to russia, where he will meet with vladimir putin, a leader he repeatedly expressed admiration for during the election, as the first step toward easing economic sanctions. which team will win the super bowl? the new york giants go on another magical run, defeating the new england patriots 27-24 – and beating them for the third time in nine years -- to win the big game. which movie will win the oscar for best picture? the oscar will go to ""moonlight"", a searing examination of a young gay black boy’s coming of age under extraordinarily challenging circumstances in florida. a film that humanizes experiences often reduced to stereotypes or flat out ignored. who will win the men’s final at wimbledon? who will win the women’s final? novak djokovic and serena williams. who will win the world series? the new york yankees shock the world with a talented young roster to win their 28th championship. who will win the nobel peace prize in 2017? bryan stevenson, founder of the equal justice institute, which has emerged as the conscience of america’s broken criminal justice system. what will be the closing level for the dow jones on the last day of 2017? the dow will close above 20,000 on the last day of the year. what will donald trump’s approval rating be in gallup’s final survey of 2017? president trump’s approval ratings will hover around 50% buoyed by wall st. friendly policies, but hurt by rhetorical gaffes, lack of press access, and endless controversies.

dean obeidallah cnn opinion contributor @thedeansreport which country will donald trump visit first as president? russia, to thank vladimir putin for his help winning the election. which team will win the super bowl? being a diehard new york giants fan i’m predicting the giants win it all. but if they don’t i will be rooting for any time playing against the dreaded new england patriots. which movie will win the oscar for best picture? rogue one: a star wars story. sure, it’s a longshot but then again so was trump. who will win the men’s final at wimbledon? who will win the women’s final? i’m sorry, i’m too busy rooting for the giants and rooting against the new england patriots to watch tennis. who will win the world series? new york mets. that was easy. who will win the nobel peace prize in 2017? not sure, but i’m pretty confident that the winner will not be named donald trump. what will be the closing level for the dow jones on the last day of 2017? 21,220.12 or 21,220.13. what will donald trump’s approval rating be in gallup’s final survey of 2017? what is the all-time lowest? whatever that is i predict trump will be below that. in fact by end of 2017 i predict the only ones approving of trump’s job as president will be named trump.

raul reyes cnn opinion contributor @raulareyes which country will donald trump visit first as president? the philippines, to see the controversial rodrigo duterte. this would bolster american influence in the pacific -- and the philippines is home to manila’s trump tower. which team will win the super bowl? the dallas cowboys. their defense is on an upswing, their offense is consistently great, and dak prescott is unstoppable. which movie will win the oscar for best picture? best picture will go to la la land: a romantic tribute to movie musicals, visually stunning, with a strong ending. oscar voters love movies about the movies. who will win the men’s final at wimbledon? who will win the women’s final? novak djokovic will make a comeback and win at wimbledon in 2017. the queen, serena williams, will too, with her amazing combination of physical and mental strength. who will win the world series? the chicago cubs will win the world series. yes, lightning will strike twice in our lifetime for this young, talented team. who will win the nobel peace prize in 2017? pope francis will win the nobel peace prize. although no pope has won the honor, he deserves it for his peace efforts and work on behalf of refugees. what will be the closing level for the dow jones on the last day of 2017? donald trump’s unpredictability will keep growth in check despite his pro-business policies. look for the dow to stay static around 19,000. what will donald trump’s approval rating be in gallup’s final survey of 2017? trump’s approval will be 40% by the end of 2017. half of the country will be exhausted by his erratic behavior, and the other half will be angry at his broken promises.

mel robbins cnn commentator @melrobbins which country will donald trump visit first as president? russia is likely the first stop, particularly with rex tillerson as secretary of state. which team will win the super bowl? new england patriots. deflategate is in the rearview mirror and brady is in his prime. the only question is whether their defense can win it. which movie will win the oscar for best picture? la la land. it’s the classic insider plot movie that the academy loves to make a winner. who will win the men’s final at wimbledon? who will win the women’s final? jo-wilfried tsonga for the men's. it’s time for an upset. and serena williams will win the women's. it's her time. who will win the world series? the chicago cubs. how epic would that be? i mean really. who will win the nobel peace prize in 2017? pope francis. i would have loved for the syria white helmets to win, but i am deeply afraid that with the current decimation of aleppo, by the time the nobel peace prize is awarded it will be last year's news. what will be the closing level for the dow jones on the last day of 2017? 15,231. what will donald trump’s approval rating be in gallup’s final survey of 2017? 43%. check out trump's twitter account and you’ll see a guy who’s primary focus is his ego -- not the 300 million people he’s been elected to serve. tweeting insults at people won’t change lives in the rust belt -- or elsewhere in the country. snl’s satirical skits about trump will remain a hit, but trump’s approval rating will be on the decline.

the emotions implied are understandable. not only was trump not supposed to win in 2016 on account of his personality and views, but also, by some counts , he didn't win. he lost the popular vote and captured the electoral college so narrowly that but for 80,000 people in three states , he would've lost.

(cnn) the president of the united states is enmeshed in scandal this week. so is kevin spacey. it feels a characteristic irony of 2017 that even as a real-life president fights allegations that could remove him from office, our most notorious fictional president is removed from the air. netflix announced on wednesday that ""house of cards,"" in which kevin spacey plays the corrupt president underwood, will not be renewed for further seasons. that spacey is now facing accusations of serious sexual misconduct, netflix assures us, is purely coincidental.

the accusations against spacey are serious. even in our post-weinstein era, it was shocking to read the actor anthony rapp's recollection of how the double academy-award winner invited him to an adult party when rapp was a child star. sometime toward the end of the night, rapp alleges he found himself sitting on spacey's bed, whereupon spacey entered the room, ""picked me up like a groom picks up the bride over the threshold,"" and made a sexual advance. rapp was 14 at the time; spacey was 26.

in response to rapp's claims, spacey released a statement in which he insisted he couldn't recall the night in question, and then said: ""but if i did behave then as he describes, i owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior."" this is an apology that will make its way into the great hall of historic nondenial denials. but the recourse to blaming bacchus isn't even the worst of it.

or is this, even worse, an attempt to suggest spacey's attraction to underage men is intrinsic to his homosexuality? those who endorse such existing and discriminatory stereotypes will be eager to read it as such. in that context, a statement that even hints at such an association merits only condemnation. few prejudices have done more damage to gay people than the myth that there is any link between sex with or sexual assault of a minor and same-sex attraction.

it matters when hollywood stars peddle this old lie or any semblance of it. because it is a lie that has caused real harm. in 1978, proposition 6, also known as the briggs initiative, appeared on the california ballot . it was part of a movement to bar gay men and women from working in schools. even teachers who ""advocated"" lgbt rights might have faced losing their jobs. the measure was eventually defeated at the ballot box, thanks to the work of campaigners like harvey milk. but those who pushed for it, like california legislator john briggs, stoked the fears of parents as they spread stories about the predator nature of homosexuals.

even as recently as 2013, when the boy scouts of america debated whether to permit gay men to join their movement, tony perkins of the family research council appeared on cnn to argue against their inclusion. his argument? that the boy scouts needed to ""create an environment that is protective of children"" and that abuse by pedophiles disproportionately involves ""male on boy"" abuse. after much debate, the scouts concluded that the presence of gay scouts and leaders posed no threat; they agreed to accept gay scouts from 2014 onward, and gay leaders from 2015, but thanks in part to the arguments by men like perkins, some parents choose now to enroll their sons in rival christian programs.

now that a high-profile hollywood star has chosen to publicly conflate his homosexuality with alleged sexual misconduct with a minor, how many more parents in small towns will whisper warnings to their children about their blameless gay teacher or lesbian church leader?

spacey's story matters because it may continue to grow. here in london, where i work as a theater critic, it's possible that stories will surface concerning spacey's behavior during his time as artistic director of the old vic theater. monday morning, on the flagship bbc ""today"" program , a leading british theater director, when asked about the allegations made by rapp, said, ""i think that many people in the theater and in the creative industries have been aware of many stories of many people over a lot of years,"" noting that ""kevin spacey would be one of the people that people have had concerns about, yes.""

dutch designer joris laarman has built his career through emerging technologies like 3d printing and robotics.

but as a student 15 years ago, he didn't even own a computer.

""after my graduation i got a computer, which changed everything,"" he said in a phone interview. ""my generation was the first to know what it was like before computers, but who also grew up with them.""

now the 37-year-old can't work without one. from open source furniture designs to a 3d-printed footbridge made from stainless steel, laarman's work lies at the intersection of design and technology.

his company, joris laarman lab , pushes at the experimental edges of an industry that has digitalized rapidly since he graduated from the design academy eindhoven in 2003.

""we're trying to figure out what the design of the future will be -- what it could look like,"" he said.

digital toolbox

one of laarman's best-known designs is the bone chair, which was created through algorithms that mimic bone growth. using a large volume of computer-generated calculations, laarman's program systematically adjusted and strengthened the chair's design.

""birds' bones have super-optimal construction -- they constantly adapt themselves by taking away material where it's not needed and adding material where it is, without losing strength,"" he explained.

""to me, an algorithm is just a new high-tech version of a saw or a pair of scissors -- it's just a tool. the designs that we make are never finished objects, they're more like programs that we can tweak into new forms and adapt themselves accordingly.""

technology is not only changing designers' methods, but also the type of products they can create. more than a simple efficiency measure, laarman says that digitalization makes entirely new concepts possible.

""(the shape of the bone chair) could never have been invented without the algorithm. you'd need really heavy calculations for such an evolutionary process.

""if you were to do this manually, without a computer, you'd have to break the legs of the chair thousands of times to make it stronger and to know where to add or take away material.""

design to download

the bone chair is set to go on display at the new york's cooper hewitt, the smithsonian design museum , alongside other highlights from laarman's career, including a set of tables made from reprogrammable molecular building blocks called voxels.

the exhibition, titled "" joris laarman lab: design in the digital age ,"" encourages visitors to interact with technologies that may soon become commonplace, said the show's curator andrea lipps.

""(experimental) designers often end up creating things that are so completely foreign that they become almost indigestible,"" she said. ""what's interesting about joris' work is that there's a familiarity to it that makes it feel less threatening. these designers are the early adopters -- they're taking our hand and leading us into the future.""

while lipps wants the exhibition to be an ""interactive, participatory experience,"" visitors won't get a chance to sit on any of laarman's chairs. they will, however, be able to download some of the design blueprints.

""you can download one (of the chairs) for free and make it yourself -- or have it produced by your neighbor if they have a 3d printer,"" laarman said. ""there are now platforms that show where the 3d printers in your neighborhood are.""

the 'next industrial revolution'

this tools used by laarman are just some of the digital methods transforming the design industry. robotics, 3d printing and virtual reality are all changing the way products are made -- from super-strong digitally fabricated materials to cars designed in thin air using vr goggles.

according to research by the consulting firm mckinsey, the cost of 3d printing fell 60 percent between 1990 and 2014, while the price of industrial robots fell by 5 percent every year between 2000 and 2012.

this move from industrial to digital production represents a fundamental shift in the economy of design, said laarman, comparing the transition to the industrial revolution.

""modernists in the early 20th century were developing new form languages for the dawn of a new industrial period. it was very much dependent on standardization and geometric shapes.

""right now, you can see digital fabrication is taking off and this leads to a completely new type of form language. it's still very early, but everybody sees the potential. digital design, biotechnology, ai and robotics are going to completely change everything in the world, at every level of society. it's very important to start working on it.""

couch was asked to teach her friend's teenage daughter how to cook. so she turned the culinary lessons into a unique summer project: preparing healthy meals for three families dealing with a serious health crisis.

in one of them, a mother of two had stage 4 breast cancer.

""in that situation, everyone is terrified and the parent who is well has this enormous burden of caregiving and working to support the family,"" couch said. ""i realized that the food was a vehicle to help relieve some of that stress.""

couch has since expanded the idea into her nonprofit, the ceres community project, which has nourished the bodies and souls of thousands of low-income people facing cancer and other serious illness in northern california.

at the heart of the work are local teens. they volunteer after school in four commercial kitchens—in sonoma, marin and alameda counties—preparing 100% organic meals for clients and their families.

couch started the ceres program to deliver healthy food to low-income people in health crisis

the organization also has a leadership training and gardening program, where teens raise about 5,000 pounds of food every year.

""youth are our future,"" couch said. ""if we give them the skills to make healthy choices for themselves and connect them to the power of community service, we're shaping a healthier future for our communities and for them personally.""

since 2007, the ceres community project has trained more than 2,000 young volunteers and delivered more than 450,000 healthy meals to sick residents.

cnn's marissa calhoun spoke with couch about her work. below is an edited version of their conversation.

cnn: cancer patients need all kinds of support. why did you choose to focus on food?

couch: one of the things that happens when people get sick is that there's all kinds of appointments they have to go to. their life becomes very complicated. and with cancer, there's also really significant impacts on people's appetite.

just watched cnn hero cathryn couch: the healing harvest replay more videos ... must watch cnn hero cathryn couch: the healing harvest 01:45

so we focus on feeding them because we know that up to 80% of cancer patients end up being malnourished—and if they're malnourished, they have worse side effects, they have worse treatment outcomes and they have longer recovery times.

food is really critical for cancer, but also for most illnesses. and yet, it tends to drop to the bottom of the priority list. by providing healthy, organic meals, we're really making a difference in people's lives.

we provide food to the whole family because we know that helps relieve the most stress, and also because everybody then learns about eating healthy food and gets excited about that.

cnn: why is it important to you to have youth take the lead in the program?

couch: i think that the teenage years are the most challenging, and i have an enormous amount of compassion for who young people are. i think we completely undervalue them in our society. i've been stunned to see who they blossom into through our program. but also it's been amazing to observe how hungry they are for an opportunity to make a difference.

ceres volunteers like harrison, 16, work in the kitchen and garden with organic ingredients

we jokingly say youth come to ceres for all kinds of reasons: they have to do community service hours. their parents think it's a good idea for them. their friend is working there. but no matter why they come, we find that they choose to stay on their own.

the truth is, youth have the same deep longing that we all do—to be valued and to belong to their communities.

cnn: aside from gaining cooking skills, how have you seen the youth benefit from this experience?

couch: one of the most important things that happens for young people in the program is that clients come to visit, and they get to really feel the impact that they're making. it's very different to see a name on a container and to know abstractly that you're cooking for someone in need. but when you're sitting across from that person and you hear their story and you hear everything they're struggling with, and then they thank you personally for being there and for making this happen for them—it really shifts how you see yourself. that's the transformation that every young person in our program has an opportunity to go through.

he launched an investigation into alleged chinese theft of u.s. intellectual property earlier this year. but some experts say a bigger concern is beijing's huge bets on the technologies of the future.

the chinese government is throwing its weight behind sectors like artificial intelligence, electric cars and computer chips, pumping in money to create tech champions with global clout.

western companies have already raised concerns about the plans, warning they may give chinese companies an unfair edge at home and abroad. some analysts have called for the u.s. to ramp up spending on technology research in order to keep pace.

as trump prepares to meet chinese president xi jinping this week, here's a look at some of the key areas where china is giving the u.s. a run for its money.

artificial intelligence

russian president vladimir putin recently predicted that whoever becomes the the leader in artificial intelligence ""will become the ruler of the world.""

china wants to be that leader. it laid out its plan this summer to become an artificial intelligence superpower by 2030.

related: elon musk says ai may cause world war iii

the country's ai industry has ""government support that most other countries don't really have,"" said john choi, an analyst who covers chinese internet companies for daiwa capital markets. ""the level of funding is not even comparable to most other nations.""

the chinese government's 2030 plan aims to build a domestic ai industry worth nearly $150 billion.

""china leads in the area for the simple reason -- it's a government push,"" said chwee kan chua, global research lead for artificial intelligence with research firm idc.

china is pouring resources into intelligent video. the sector is developing ""smart"" cameras that can detect unusual patterns and flag them to officials or law enforcement. it shows how china's ruling communist party can brush aside privacy issues in order to gather tons of footage to fuel ai research.

in the name of public safety, the chinese government ""will have cameras everywhere in every single corner that can track movements, objects and people so it can build huge database analytics to train artificial intelligence,"" chua said.

the push isn't just coming from the public sector. like their u.s. rivals, chinese tech giants alibaba (baba, tech30), baidu (bidu, tech30) and tencent (tcehy) are investing heavily in ai and setting up research centers in the u.s.

electric cars

there's a reason why tesla (tsla) is eager to have a manufacturing plant in china. the country has the world's largest market for electric vehicles, thanks to years of generous tax credits and government subsidies.

china's efforts are yielding results for its homegrown industry. domestic companies are among the leading makers of electric vehicles in the world, and chinese consumers are increasingly interested in buying them.

related: china wants to ban gas and diesel cars

beijing is doubling down on the industry. the country's ""made in china 2025"" plan calls for domestically produced hybrid vehicles and electric cars to account for at least 70% of total sales by 2025.

major global automakers like volkswagen (vlkaf) and ford (f) have recently announced plans to develop electric cars in china with local partners, bringing their technological know-how into the country.

the government is also building a nationwide network of public charging stations. the number of outlets stood at 150,000 at the end of last year and authorities aim to add another 100,000 this year, according to state media.

in the u.s., meanwhile, the tax reform bill wending its way through congress would kill a federal tax credit of as much as $7,500 for americans who buy an electric car.

computer chips

china is far and away the biggest buyer of semiconductors, the computer chips used in everything from iphones to automobiles. it consumed nearly 60% of the $354 billion global semiconductor market in 2015, according to pricewaterhousecoopers.

but the u.s. has the largest semiconductor industry, with u.s.-based companies accounting for about half of the global market, according to research from the semiconductor industry association.

if beijing has its way, that will soon change.

the republicans' latest attempt to fulfill their years-long pledge would effectively repeal obamacare in 2020, giving lawmakers until then to come up with a replacement plan.
the idea unexpectedly resurfaced earlier this week after republicans' effort to repeal and replace obamacare ran aground in the senate on monday night.
senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said he would call a vote on a repeal bill modeled on 2015 legislation that was passed by both chambers before being vetoed by then-president obama.
also, it would not curtail federal support for the overall medicaid program as the house and senate health care bills would have. THIS IS A GLOBAL NEWS","a new senate bill to repeal obamacare would leave 32 million more people uninsured by 2026 than under current law, according to a congressional budget office analysis released wednesday.

the republicans' latest attempt to fulfill their years-long pledge would effectively repeal obamacare in 2020, giving lawmakers until then to come up with a replacement plan.

the ramifications of not replacing the law immediately would be severe. three-quarters of the nation would live in areas with no insurers participating in the individual market by 2026 -- leaving many without an option if they do not have employer-provided or government health insurance, such as medicare or medicaid.

also, premiums would about double by 2026, compared to current law, the cbo found.

it's unlikely gop lawmakers will approve this bill, though these frightening figures will make it even harder for them to proceed down this path. house republican leaders cast aside an attempt to swiftly and simply repeal obamacare earlier this year after encountering stiff opposition from fellow lawmakers and others, who said it was critical to come up with a replacement bill at the same time.

the idea unexpectedly resurfaced earlier this week after republicans' effort to repeal and replace obamacare ran aground in the senate on monday night. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said he would call a vote on a repeal bill modeled on 2015 legislation that was passed by both chambers before being vetoed by then-president obama.

this bill, unveiled wednesday afternoon, is meant to be a wake-up call for republican senators, to serve as a reminder that most of them voted for it just two years ago. mcconnell is essentially daring republicans to reverse their vote and support the status quo they've been campaigning against for seven years.

related: trump to gop senators: 'inaction is not an option'

the cbo score could also pressure republicans to consider going back to the negotiating table to find a path forward on their more comprehensive health care bill, which would leave 22 million more americans uninsured over the next decade. that is what president trump asked them to do on wednesday during their lunch at the white house, though earlier in the week he called for lawmakers to repeal the obamacare now and replace it later.

the administration pushed back on the report.

""we continue to believe that cbo's methodology is flawed, and this score fails to take into account the president's full plan, which includes a replacement for obamacare and administrative actions to reduce costs and expand access to quality, affordable care,"" a white house official said.

here's what the new bill would do:

-- get rid of the individual and employer mandates, two of the least favorite provisions of the law, by reducing the penalty to $0. this provision would be retroactive to 2016.

-- effectively end obamacare in 2020 by eliminating the federal subsidies that help people afford individual coverage.

-- eliminate medicaid expansion starting in 2020.

-- repeal taxes on the wealthy, health insurers, medical device makers and others.

-- defund planned parenthood for one year.

-- increase funding for substance abuse and mental health needs by $1.5 billion over two years.

enacting the legislation would decrease deficits by $473 billion over the next decade, however this doesn't take into account the cost of a replacement plan.

related: will obamacare really fail?

in some important ways, however, this bill repeals less of obamacare than the legislation that passed the house and the version that was under consideration in the senate until this week. it doesn't touch obamacare's insurance provisions, including the immensely popular protections for those with pre-existing conditions. that will make it more likely to comply with senate rules that will allow it to be passed with a simple majority.

also, it would not curtail federal support for the overall medicaid program as the house and senate health care bills would have.

still, repealing obamacare without replacing it would throw the individual market into chaos, prompting insurers to start exiting swiftly. lawmakers wouldn't have a lot of time to come up with a replacement, said cynthia cox, associate director at the kaiser family foundation.

insurers are mid-negotiation for participating next year. repeal without a replacement will destabilize the market in 2018. — cynthia cox (@cynthiaccox) july 19, 2017

some 17 million fewer people would be insured next year, leaving only an estimated 84% of americans covered, compared to 90% under current law, the cbo found. premiums would be roughly 25% higher mainly because many younger and healthier people would drop their coverage since they would no longer be penalized for being uninsured.

by 2026, a total of some 59 million people would lack coverage under this bill, compared to 28 million under current law, the agency estimated.

(cnn) — upon hearing i would have to climb 1,015 steps to reach the summit of yamadera risshakuji temple in japan , my immediate reaction was admittedly pathetic.

i inspected the temple complex's on-site map closer, trying to locate the entrance to the funicular. a futile exercise. there was no funicular. yamadera risshakuji temple, located on mount hoju-san in japan's yamagata prefecture, isn't about shortcuts. and thankfully so.

i would have missed out on one of the most rewarding experiences of my entire japan journey.





















1 / 11 a temple complex located in japan's yamagata prefecture, yamadera offers incredible views of the surrounding countryside -- if you're willing to work for them. though the buddhist site's official name is risshakuji temple, it's more commonly referred to as yamadera by the locals, meaning ""mountain temple."" pongpat patumsuwon/cnn

though its official name is risshakuji, locals refer to it simply as yamadera -- which means ""mountain temple."" the temple complex, founded in ad 860 to oversee the northern tohoku region's tendai buddhism sect, is actually made up of more than a dozen various sites of religious importance, such as shrines, gates and monuments.

that includes the konpon-chudo hall, which is said to house a buddhist flame that's been burning continuously for more than 1,000 years. the hiho-kan (treasure hall), built in 1144, is where yamadera's most precious buddhist artifacts are held.

tackling the 1,015 steps

climbing the 1,015-step staircase that winds its way up mount hoju-san to the temple's main hall -- okunoin -- is intended to be a meditative experience.

someone obviously didn't tell that to the half a dozen or so packs of middle school students i encountered on the trail during my visit.

many cried out in exaggerated agony as they gripped the staircase railing, while the athletes of the group charged ahead, stoically looking forward as they took the stairs two at a time. but this was not a race to the top. camaraderie was on full display. descending hikers offered nods of encouragement to those of us making the ascent, many saying ""konnichiwa"" as they passed.

sympathetic gazes were cast upon a sweat-drenched father making the climb while carrying his toddler daughter, who sat in a carrier on his back. fortunately, stopping is encouraged.

whether it's a stone sculpture in front of a cliff wall that's embedded with thousands of one-yen coins or a burst of fiery red leaves hanging just perfectly over a shrine, there are plenty of plausible excuses to pause and catch your breath. and when you finally do reach the summit, the payoff is instant. interestingly it's not the okunoin main hall that's the biggest draw.

before you even reach okunoin you'll pass what are likely the two most photographed buildings at yamadera: kaisando hall and the small red nokyodo building, which tower over the valley below.

a nearby path takes visitors to the wooden observation platform, godaido, which gives incredible views of the surrounding yamagata countryside.

the facts:predators target kids who post revealing pictures, divulge past sexual abuse, and/or engage in sexual talk online. THIS IS A GLOBAL NEWS","every parent worries about online predators at some point. and while it's smart to be cautious, the facts show that it's actually fairly rare for kids to be contacted by adult strangers seeking sexual communication. of course it's natural to be concerned when your kid goes into an unknown world. but instead of acting out of fear, arm yourself with the facts so that you can help your kids be smart, cautious, and savvy. if the concerns below ring true, use some of these strategies to be proactive in protecting your kids -- they'll make your kid safer and help you feel a lot better.

the concern: every time i read the news, it feels like there's an article about some creep contacting a kid in a game.

the facts:

the strategy: more than inspiring fear in our kids, we want to arm them with information. so when you talk to your kid, tell them there's a chance someone could approach them online to get personal information, exchange pictures, and/or meet in person, and it might be someone who feels like an online friend. it's not the norm, and it's not a reason to be afraid all the time. it's simply a reason to be aware and know that if someone starts asking for personal information or talking about sexual stuff, it's time to get help from an adult.

the concern: i can't keep up with all of the media my kid is into, so i don't know what games and apps to keep my eye on.

the facts:

according to the new england journal of public policy, contact with online predators happens mostly in chat rooms, on social media, or in the chat feature of a multiplayer game (roblox, minecraft, clash of clans, world of warcraft, and so on).

most games meant for kids -- like roblox and animal jam -- have built-in features and settings that are designed to prevent inappropriate comments and chat. though they're often imperfect, they do help.

games that aren't designed only for kids have fewer controls, settings, and safeguards.

any app or online space that allows contact with strangers without moderation or age verification can allow contact between kids and adult strangers.

teens sometimes visit adult sites, chat rooms, and dating apps out of curiosity about sex and romance.

the strategy: first, stay on top of what your kid is doing online by asking them which apps, games, and other tech they use. if they're on social media, friend or follow them. set rules about first, stay on top of what your kid is doing online by asking them which apps, games, and other tech they use. if they're on social media, friend or follow them. set rules about times and places for device use -- for example, banning phones and tablets from bedrooms. find out how they chat -- is it through an app or through their phone's sms texting? (if they're using an app, it won't be easy for you to see it, so ask to do occasional spot checks.) make rules around who they can chat with -- for instance, only people they know in real life. if your kid's a gamer, use these questions to probe deeper: do you like multiplayer games -- and why? do you chat with others while you're gaming? what's been your experience so far? what would you do if someone you didn't know contacted you? help them set privacy settings to limit the contacts in their games.

the concern: i don't even understand how this works -- does an adult pose as a kid, then ask to meet?

the facts:

only 5 percent of online predators pretend they're kids. most reveal that they're older -- which is especially appealing to 12-to-15-year-olds who are most often targeted.

some predators initiate sexual talk or request pictures immediately and back off if refused. they're in it for an immediate result.

in contrast, some predators engage in ""bunny hunting,"" which is the process of picking a potential victim for ""grooming"": they'll look at social media posts and public chats to learn about the kid first.

once they've selected someone, they may begin the grooming phase, which often involves friending the target's contacts, engaging in increasingly personal conversations to build trust, taking the conversation to other platforms (like instant messaging), requesting pictures, and finally requesting offline contact.

sometimes if a kid shares one compromising picture, a predator will engage in ""sextortion,"" which involves demanding more pictures or contact under threat of exposure or harm.

the strategy: we often tell kids not to talk to strangers or share personal information, but a kid's online relationships can feel just as real as their offline ones. so before they start chatting with anyone online, kids need to know some basic digital citizenship and online privacy information. for instance, kids should never share a phone number, address, or even last name with someone they've never met. also, sharing sexy pictures or being overtly sexual online leaves an unwanted legacy, with or without creepy adults, so we need to teach kids about being mindful about their we often tell kids not to talk to strangers or share personal information, but a kid's online relationships can feel just as real as their offline ones. so before they start chatting with anyone online, kids need to know some basic digital citizenship and online privacy information. for instance, kids should never share a phone number, address, or even last name with someone they've never met. also, sharing sexy pictures or being overtly sexual online leaves an unwanted legacy, with or without creepy adults, so we need to teach kids about being mindful about their digital footprint . plus, having nude pictures of a minor -- even if you are a minor -- is against the law and teens can get into legal trouble as a result. finally, it's important to teach kids that if someone is asking a kid for sexy pictures or chat, that person is not a friend, no matter how cool or understanding they seem.

the concern: how would i even know if this is happening to my kid if they don't come out and tell me?

the facts:

predators target kids who post revealing pictures, divulge past sexual abuse, and/or engage in sexual talk online.

there's some conflicting research about what ages are most at-risk, but 12 to 15 seems to be prime time, and girls are more frequent victims.

teen boys who are questioning their sexuality are the second-most targeted group because they often feel talking about it online is safer than sharing in real life.

sometimes, teens egg each other on to pursue contact with strangers online, and it can feel like a game.

teens want to feel special, validated, attractive, and understood at a time when they're separating from their parents, so an older ""friend"" who's very interested in them can feel exciting and special.

most often, teens engage in relationships with predators willingly, though they often keep them secret.

if your kid withdraws and becomes secretive around a device (hiding the screen, clicking from a window suddenly), it could be an indicator.

phone calls and gifts from unknown people are possible signs.

porn on the device your kid uses might be a sign.

the strategy: the tricky part is that most tweens and teens withdraw and are sometimes secretive; it's part of their development. if, however, you notice these in the extreme, that's a concern -- no matter the reason. spot checks on the devices your kid uses to monitor for sexy posts and pictures and the tricky part is that most tweens and teens withdraw and are sometimes secretive; it's part of their development. if, however, you notice these in the extreme, that's a concern -- no matter the reason. spot checks on the devices your kid uses to monitor for sexy posts and pictures and knowing some lingo can help, but open communication -- without accusation or overreaction -- is usually the most effective.

your kid told you.

you saw something on his or her phone or social media.

join the conversation see the latest news and share your comments with cnn health on facebook and twitter.

the strategy: first, don't panic. instead, gather evidence: take screenshots, save communications, and so on. talk with your kid about the details without making them feel like it's their fault or that they're in trouble. then report it to the platform or service your kid is using, block the person, and find the reporting features on other apps and games your kid uses together. finally, contact the police. even though it may seem like a one-time thing, that it's over, or you don't want to make it a big deal, it's best to let the authorities know in case the person is a known offender and to prevent them from doing it to other kids.

by early afternoon, lesli, dortha and tom meet with staff for her annual review, going over her care for the upcoming year. THIS IS A GLOBAL NEWS","cypress, texas (cnn) dortha biggs enters through the front door and rushes to greet her daughter, lesli, who sits in a recliner, curled in fetal position.

mother and daughter lock hands and begin a ritualistic rubbing of hands, the only way they can communicate. it's rhythmic and intimate, beautiful and heartbreaking. lesli squeals as her mother holds her right hand and pats her left.

a smile starts to radiate from lesli's face.

""looka there,"" dortha says. ""are you going to smile? can you smile? there's that smile!""

ever since lesli was born 48 years ago, dortha has longed to hear her daughter say a single word. she cried more tears than anyone can imagine, rocking young lesli every night for years on end. mom would get maybe an hour or two of sleep before heading off to her teaching job.

""because you just care so much,"" dortha says.

dortha contracted rubella when she was 2½ weeks pregnant, before she even knew that she was expecting. although she got better, the virus took root in her fetus' bone cells, nerve cells and skin cells. it would leave lesli blind, deaf and severely brain-damaged. she spent 100 days in the hospital before her first birthday and has undergone more than 20 surgeries over the years, including an open-heart operation at 3 months that left her ribs broken.

lesli has lived in a houston-area group home since 2000. dortha, 77, now lives in oklahoma and visits as often as she can, about eight times a year. as the two hold hands, dortha ponders whether her daughter knows who she is.

""i don't think she's aware that i'm her mother,"" she says. ""i think she is aware that i'm someone special who cares about her.""

dortha biggs rubs her daughter's hands, the only means they have of communicating.

it's been a grueling journey for both. mom yearns for the one thing that is unattainable: for lesli to get better or just to enjoy the simplicities of life. lesli lives in a dark, silent, isolated world in her group home, unable to communicate with her mother beyond touch.

four decades earlier, mother and daughter made headlines when the texas supreme court issued a landmark ruling. dortha had sued her doctor, accusing him of failing to diagnose the rubella. if she'd known, she would have had an abortion.

on february 19, 1975 -- three years after roe v. wade -- about 60 women filed into the supreme court chamber in unison and took up seats in support of dortha's case. the women heard a decision that stunned the legal community and reversed lower court rulings that had sided with the doctor.

the high court's ruling set a precedent that said a woman could sue her doctor for a ""wrongful birth.""

dortha, who stayed home, learned of the ruling through the news.

this year, the news brought dortha another shock: a texas state senator had introduced a bill that would ban such lawsuits -- in essence, overturning the precedent she helped set. and he invoked her case, saying wrongful birth lawsuits such as hers promoted abortion.

""the presence of a disability in a child should not be grounds for a lawsuit,"" sen. brandon creighton told his colleagues. ""it sends the message that there are births that are wrongful. there are no wrongful births.""

dortha was outraged.

never once did a lawmaker reach out to her. never was she asked to testify in committee hearings. never did they ask about lesli.

if they had, she would have told them of the pain her daughter has suffered since she was born march 8, 1969, in wichita falls, texas. of traveling more than 100,000 miles to hospitals in dallas, baltimore, washington and san francisco -- anything to give her little lesli the best shot in life.

""if you have not watched your daughter suffer pain -- pain that was just hell -- for days and days,"" dortha says, ""you cannot even grasp the pain that you experience.""

she'd have told those under the capitol dome how she dedicated her life to special needs children for more than 30 years. of designing the curriculum for disabled children in public schools, first in dallas and then in wichita falls.

lesli's portrait hangs on the wall at the group home where she lives.

tormented by the virus that wrecked her child, she wrote her master's thesis on rubella and its devastating effects in pregnancy.

many nights, dortha weeps.

""i would have given anything to have never been born,"" she says. ""because had i not been born, she would not have been born and suffered this.""

a legal legacy

dortha is like a hawk, making sure lesli's hair is cut short so she won't yank it out, checking to make sure her wheelchair works and monitoring the cleanliness of her bedroom.

the day after her visit, a scene reminiscent of the 1975 texas supreme court ruling played out across the state in austin.

more than a dozen women dressed in long red robes and white bonnets sat in the chamber of the texas senate, their outfits matching characters from ""the handmaid's tale,"" the popular dystopian novel that explores themes of power, gender and religion in politics.

they were there to protest two anti-abortion measures, including the bill that would undo dortha's legal legacy.

it's a saga that began in the summer of 1968. deposition transcripts tell the story:

dortha had fallen ill with ""nausea, shivering attacks, cramping of the stomach"" during a july fourth trip with her husband to port aransas on the texas coast.

a pinpoint rash broke out across the top of her face and eventually extended ""downward to other portions"" of her body, including her legs.

the possibility of being pregnant was the last thing on her mind. she was 28 and on birth control. she had a son and had planned to have a second child sometime down the road.

she spoke by phone with dr. louis m. theimer, the well-regarded family practitioner in wichita falls who opened his practice in 1953 and delivered hundreds, if not thousands, of the town's babies. he'd delivered dortha's first child, jake, on december 24, 1961.

theimer had seen her just before the trip. she wasn't feeling well then, but she told him she was feeling much worse now.

dortha and her husband of 32 years, tom biggs, visit lesli as often as they can.

she first saw a doctor in port aransas and was given antibiotics. when she returned home, she was still ill. she saw theimer on july 11, 1968. he believed she might be pregnant and ran a test. she mentioned that she had a rash on her vacation but didn't ask about the possibility of rubella, also known as german measles -- at least not yet.

four days later, dortha returned and was informed that she was indeed pregnant. she broke down, fearing that the rash was rubella and that her fetus would be harmed.

it was the summer of 1968. a rubella epidemic had swept across the united states from 1963 to 1965. the diagnosis during pregnancy was a deep fear among any expectant mother, similar to how zika took hold in central and south america last summer. rubella was known to cause deafness, blindness, heart disease, neuromuscular tightness, seizures and extreme intellectual disabilities. if the mother got rubella in the first two months of pregnancy, it was known to be especially debilitating, continuing to live in the child long after birth.

""i was alarmed,"" dortha testified. ""he told me the test was positive and i was pregnant.""

""i said ... 'could this rash that i had have been measles?' and his statement was, 'no, if you hadn't had measles (as a child), you would have had them in the '64-'65 epidemic.' ""

in his deposition, theimer equivocated when asked about that conversation but acknowledged that he believed her rash was from an antibiotic, not rubella.

three times during her pregnancy, dortha's body tried to spontaneously abort. believing her child to be healthy, each time she agreed for shots to be administered to stop her contractions and save the fetus.

""after i was told i did not have rubella, i very definitely wanted the baby,"" she testified.

and what would she have done if she'd been informed that she had rubella?

""i would have done the kindest thing that i could have known to have done for her,"" dortha said, ""and that would have been to terminate the pregnancy.""

abortions were illegal in texas at the time. she said she would've traveled to colorado for the procedure.

theimer acknowledged that he never ran a test on dortha to determine the presence of rubella antibodies. ""no, i never did,"" he said.

born blind, deaf and severely brain-damaged, lesli jacobs lives in a silent world.

a christian, the doctor said he had no religious scruples against abortion. he added that he would inform patients if he believed they have ""a possibility of having a deformed fetus.""

""that's what i tell them, but i think the choice after that is theirs,"" theimer said.

""i agree with you. that's the whole case,"" dortha's attorney shot back. ""doctor, did you give this patient of yours that choice medically?""

""no,"" he said. ""i didn't think she ever had rubella.""

'no right to judge'

it's those words that still haunt, still sting. time has not healed the wounds of the doctor's misdiagnosis.

""now, they're punishing me again,"" she says of the legislation at the state capitol.

the fact that creighton, the bill's author, implied that people like her were just looking for a payout, she says, is ""beyond insulting."" creighton also argued that the mere threat of wrongful birth suits kept the best doctors from setting up practice in texas and could lead to a shortage.

to this, dortha says, ""despicable.""

""it would've been nice if they'd just contacted me.""

infuriated at the news of the measure, her fingers clapped at her keyboard as she typed a letter to creighton.

""i have stood over her bed for hundreds of nights watching her suffering,"" she wrote. ""if you have not experienced this heartbreak, you have no right to judge.""

dortha and lesli made headlines when the texas supreme court agreed parents could sue doctors for ""wrongful birth.""

after the supreme court ruling, her family received about $120,000 in a settlement reached with theimer -- money that was placed in a special needs trust for lesli. at the time, the family owed $21,472 in medical bills. back then, dortha made just $4,200 a year as a teacher.

after the suit, she was forced to move from wichita falls to dallas because doctors back home refused to treat her two children. her marriage to lesli's father didn't survive the move.

dortha has left the money in the trust mostly untouched in recent years, preferring to pay lesli's out-of-pocket costs with her own money. it's a burden she's more than willing to take on. that way, there is money left for lesli's care long after mom is gone.

dortha keeps a yellow scrapbook called ""the first six years."" the first page announces lesli's birth, hailing the 6-pound, 10½-ounce girl. next to it, a black-and-white photograph shows lesli with her mouth open and both fists clenched.

memories burst from the album's pages. lesli's 7-year-old brother, jake, beams on the couch, his little sister in his arms. on her 4th birthday, lesli sits in front of a giant cake shaped like a teddy bear.

the message below, like others in the scrapbook, is in lesli's voice, written as her mother imagined it: ""i have now learned to sit alone, and in four more months, i will crawl. my teachers worked on helping me sit for over three years.""

turn the page. lesli is sprawled out, crawling. ""i no longer have to just lie where someone places me.""

but there are sobering reminders, too.

""at one time, i took over 40 medications daily.""

""if only you could hear me long enough to say, 'i love you.' ""

on the back page is a final note, which dortha reads in a soft, hushed texas twang.

""this has been the story of my first 6 years. i have brought a new kind of love and strength into the lives of many,"" she reads.

""i have fought hard and suffered to live. very few days of my life are without pain, but still i smile.""

dortha, right, and her husband have spent countless hours touching and stroking lesli.

mom closes the book and uses tissue to dab her eyes.

""i did try for so long to think that things would be a lot better, and then you start accepting,"" she says. ""you have to learn to accept that some things are going to just be.""

dortha accepted that the milestones would become few and far between. lesli would never learn to stand on her own. she would never speak. she would never hear her mom's words: ""i love you.""

who gets to decide?

lesli sits in a wheelchair in her room, her head hunched over. she sports a crew cut. if her hair grows out much more than an inch, she'll pull it out. one of her eyes was removed due to cataracts. her other is so deteriorated, it's hard to tell whether it's even there.

her group home sits in a cul-de-sac in cypress, texas, about 25 miles northwest of houston. the spacious three-bedroom brick home with wood siding blends in well with the four residential homes on the street. the only thing that distinguishes the house is the specialty van with wheelchair access in the driveway.

it's a home she shares with five others, all of whom receive round-the-clock care.

the letters l-e-s-l-i gaze down from the wall above her bed. next to them rests a cowboy hat.

dortha rubs her daughter's right hand. dortha's husband of 32 years, tom biggs, runs his fingers back and forth across the back of her neck. dortha decided he was a keeper when he didn't cut and run like most guys upon seeing the severity of lesli's disabilities.

""he has patted hands as many hours as i have,"" she says.

dortha never gave birth to another child. shortly after lesli was born, she was told that her baby was perfect. she had her tubes tied three days later. the following week, dortha spotted cataracts in her daughter's eyes, the start of the arduous journey they're still traveling.

standing over her daughter, dortha has a message for the senator who drafted the bill. ""senator creighton has not stood where i have stood or walked in my shoes. he has not,"" she says. ""he has not stood and watched a child suffer like this.""

she says it's interesting that the current administration in washington, as well as texas lawmakers, wants to deregulate everything from the epa to banks to businesses. ""but when it comes to the most intimate decisions an individual has to make, it's 'let's put more regulations on that.'

""i'm the one who should have made the decision.""

does she still wish her daughter had never been born?

""yes,"" she says.

lesli has lived in this group home since 2000; she shares it with five others.

holding her daughter's right hand, dortha chokes up. lesli places her mother's right hand on the back of her neck. mom strokes her daughter's head. tom rubs lesli's left arm.

mom continues talking through her tears: ""because i have had the joy of loving her, but i've had the sorrow of watching her suffer. she has suffered so much of her life. if she could have come through the suffering and come through it and be able to enjoy her life more, i think it would have been a different issue.""

mother and daughter now hold hands. lesli moans. ""but, no, i could never have said i want her to experience this -- just to be born. anyone who would say they thought that was the right thing to do has not stood and watched a child suffer like this.""

she understands that those words in her daughter's presence might come across as cruel or twisted, but she reiterates that it's for the love of her daughter and the freedom from her pain that she wishes she'd had an abortion or allowed her body to abort naturally.

""i could never have made the choice to have terminated the pregnancy for me or the hardships that it would bring on me,"" she says. ""but i could have in a heartbeat for her -- knowing what she was going to go through.'""

'the wrong message'

more than a dozen specialty vans line up about 8:30 a.m. at a community center about 15 minutes from lesli's home. it's on the grounds of the faith-based nonprofit that runs lesli's home and several others in the surrounding area.

every weekday, about 70 residents from the various group homes are driven to the center for specialized treatment.

it's the first day of spring, and the texas heat is already suffocating, pushing 80 degrees.

lesli is helped from her van in her wheelchair and escorted into a cavernous building with polished floors. she comes here for therapy and worship.

once in class, lesli takes up a seat in a beige recliner and relaxes. class leader catherine konneh brings over bean bags and rubber balls so she can feel them. lesli pushes them away.

konneh tries a variety of scents to arouse her olfactory senses. lesli holds her nose over the smell of strawberry and takes in the aroma.

konneh's goal for lesli is to someday wash her hands on her own. ""i keep (the residents) active,"" she says, ""so that whatever skills they have, they won't lose them.""

next, everyone moves to the fellowship hall, where therapy dogs greet the crowd. lesli seems more interested in the touch of the dog handlers than the dogs. she grabs the trainers' hands and places them on the back of her neck. when a fluffy white dog named lammie licks her face, she backs up her wheelchair.

but a black pooch named omri makes a breakthrough. omri places one paw on her leg, and she pets him with the help of the handler.

lesli pushed away bean bags and rubber balls but welcomed the chance to pet omri with his handler's help.

by early afternoon, lesli, dortha and tom meet with staff for her annual review, going over her care for the upcoming year. the severity of her disabilities are rattled off: blind, deaf, cerebral palsy, allergies, seizure disorder, autism.

even the most minute details are covered. all tags on her shirts must be cut off because they annoy her. her wheelchair footrest must be down at all times to keep her from falling. pay attention to her picking at her underwear. she prefers hot lunches, preferably noodles with no msg.

lesli moans through much of the session and plays with konneh's hands while mom listens.

her care for the upcoming year will cost about $200,000. medicare and medicaid will cover most of it.

more than two hours away in austin, state senators take up the wrongful birth bill.

dressed in a navy suit and light blue tie, creighton stands on the floor and tells his colleagues that senate bill 25 prohibits ""patients from suing their physician for lifelong payments, claiming that they would not have had their baby had they known different information. it removes the wrongful birth cause of action.""

he says doctors currently are ""overcautiously suggesting termination in order to protect themselves.""

democratic sen. jose rodriguez of el paso pushes back, saying the current law exists to protect women like dortha and remains relevant even today. he said the texas supreme court found that the doctor ""had failed to carry out his obligation of fully informing the patient.""

""it's about ultimately the woman's right to receive accurate information from her doctor, so she can make an informed choice,"" rodriguez says.

the bill sails through. it must now go before the house for final approval.

creighton soaks in the moment not too long after the vote. he tells cnn senior medical correspondent elizabeth cohen that it is time for the ""archaic 40-year-old cause of action"" to go away.

""it just sends the wrong message,"" he says. ""it sends a message that the best physicians in america should not practice in texas because ... you have to consider that you could be held liable just for doing your job correctly.""

told that's not true -- and certainly not what happened in dortha's case -- creighton insists that he's correct because lawyers are clever and ""you can be sued for anything.""

lesli touches the plants as she is wheeled outside. on weekdays, she attends therapy at a nearby community center.

asked why he never contacted dortha, he offers several answers. first, he says it's because of privacy concerns -- even though he brought her case into the fight. then, he says he can't contact everyone from past cases about new legislation. he says he plans to respond to her letter but hasn't had time. he says he hopes to meet her one day.

he says he was especially moved by her ""exceptional"" letter. ""i'm very, very proud of her, almost to a heroic standpoint, just what it takes to raise a child and the challenges in disabilities.""

legal experts say wrongful birth suits are rarely filed and certainly don't scare doctors from opening up practice in texas. one former director of the texas medical board told a senate panel that her agency had investigated only five wrongful birth cases since 1975, according to courthouse news service.

and while creighton maintains that an expectant mother who is given a wrong diagnosis during pregnancy would still have other means to pursue a lawsuit, legal scholars say that is not true.

if you take away the wrongful birth cause of action, ""there is no other action,"" said george annas, director of the center for health law, ethics & human rights at boston university.

""what this guy doesn't like is making a decision to terminate a pregnancy,"" annas said. ""he doesn't want you to do that.""

that motivation was on display just before creighton answered cnn's questions. a lawmaker stopped by and slapped him on the back: ""congratulations, you're the only senator who's gotten a pro-life bill through this session.""

the irony, dortha says, is that the first thing to go when gop-led legislatures begin slashing budgets is money for programs serving the special-needs and mentally ill communities. put more precisely, she says, they care only when a child is in the womb, not after.

""they don't love my daughter. they don't know my daughter,"" she says.

if they cared, she says, they would have contacted her. they would have toured her daughter's group home. they would have held lesli's hand. THIS IS A GLOBAL NEWS",when you wish your baby had never been born

marburg virus disease, which causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever, ranks among the most virulent pathogens known to infect humans, according to the world health organization.

as of saturday, two confirmed cases, one probable case and two suspected cases have been reported in the kween district, on the border with kenya, tarik jašarević, a spokesman for the who, wrote in an email. the confirmed and probable cases -- two brothers and a sister -- have died.

the first case detected by the ministry of health was a 50-year-old woman who died at a health center of fever, bleeding, vomiting and diarrhea on october 11. one of the woman's brothers died of similar symptoms three weeks earlier and was buried in a traditional ceremony. a game hunter, the man lived near a cave inhabited by rousettus bats, which are natural hosts of the marburg virus.

laboratory tests at the uganda virus research institute in entebbe confirmed that marburg was the cause of both deaths.

the who, which is working with ugandan health authorities to contain the outbreak, has followed up with 135 contacts of the patients, jašarević said. some positive news has come of these investigations: blood tests showed no infection in two health care workers who had previously been classified as suspected cases.

still, several hundred people may have been exposed to the virus at health facilities and at traditional burial ceremonies in the kween district, according to the who.

""marburg is a virus that is in the same family as ebola, and it basically has very similar characteristics,"" said dr. amesh adalja, a spokesman for the infectious disease society of america. ""so it spreads in blood and body fluids and thrives in areas in which people are not able to do effective infection control and take care of patients with appropriate personal protection equipment.""

although direct contact with the blood, secretions or other bodily fluids from infected people spreads the disease, touching contaminated surfaces and materials (such as clothing or bedding) may also spread the virus.

symptoms and mortality rate

once transmitted, the virus incubates for two to 21 days. high fever, severe headache and extreme lethargy are the most prominent symptoms, which may also include muscle aches, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, nausea and vomiting. hemorrhaging begins between five and seven days after the fever starts. fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding, often from multiple areas.

patients appear ""ghost-like,"" with drawn features, deep-set eyes and expressionless faces, according to the who.

on average, the mortality rate is about 50% for this hemorrhagic fever, which was first detected in 1967 during simultaneous outbreaks in marburg and frankfurt, germany, and in belgrade, serbia. during previous outbreaks, though, fatality rates have varied from 24% to 88% depending on the viral strain and how well health authorities managed the disease, according to the who.

currently, there are no treatments for marburg virus disease.

""the medical interventions are largely going to be supportive care -- very similar to ebola,"" said adalja, a board-certified infectious disease physician. fever control will be most important, he added, and patients may be treated with intravenous fluids and, in more advanced health care settings, electrolyte replacement.

""those types of interventions were found to be very beneficial during ebola,"" adalja said. some of the experimental drugs that were tried during the ebola outbreak in western africa three years ago may have some effect on this virus, he said, so ""on the ground, you may see some of the experimental antiviral therapies being used.""

vaccines are in development for both marburg and ebola, with most attention given to ebola, though some vaccines may be beneficial in protecting against marburg and the same family of viruses, adalja said.

beyond these medical obstacles, the who reported that it faces challenges in the form of misinformation, superstition and suspicion among residents in the areas at risk.

'double-edged' situation

kween district , a mountainous area 300 kilometers (about 186 miles) northeast of kampala, boasts a total population of 93,667 people, according to the uganda bureau of statistics. about a third of the population is illiterate, and just 4% of households have access to electricity. over 90% of households grow crops, while more than 80% breed livestock. subsistence farming is the main source of livelihood for 84% of the households.

many people in this rural district believe witchcraft is responsible for the deaths that have occurred in their community, according to the who. the community members also do not hold health systems and workers in high regard, with many suspecting that health workers are deliberately killing some people to save others from the mysterious disease.

""convincing people to go to hospital is proving a daunting task for community engagement responders,"" a who news bulletin says.

jašarević noted, for example, one of the confirmed cases who traveled into kenya ""in search of traditional healers.""

the man, a ugandan national, crossed into kenya at the village of bwayi. there, medical personnel suspected that he might be suffering from the hemorrhagic fever and placed him in quarantine in trans-nzoia county in western kenya as of tuesday, health authorities confirmed. his samples were taken to the kenya medical research institute for testing.

the villagers of kween also search caves for bat droppings, which are considered good manure for their crops.

direct transmission from bats to humans is possible, yet the virus can also ""spill between bats and non-human primates, such as monkeys, chimpanzees and gorillas, and from there it may be going into humans,"" adalja said.

a few cases from animal exposure can get amplified by human transmission and other factors, such as ""non-ideal infection control procedures in health care facilities,"" he added. ""we know that burial practices, just as we saw with ebola, can foster the spread of this virus as well."" burial practices, which include washing the deceased in preparation for funerals, facilitate contact with bodily fluids.

the outbreak, though cause for concern, is far from hopeless.

""although marburg is a scary, deadly disease, it's not very contagious,"" adalja said. if people are provided with protective equipment and they change their burial practices, the outbreak can be contained and extinguished.

""you have to remember that uganda has dealt with ebola and marburg outbreaks for several decades. they are usually very adept at dealing with these,"" adalja said. ""it's not completely foreign the way ebola was in west africa.""

for the current outbreak, prevention and containment activities are underway as health authorities continue to investigate family and community contacts.

""public health authorities are reaching out to people and giving them actionable public health messages that they understand and can be followed,"" adalja said.

the situation in uganda is ""double-edged,"" he said. ""the fact that this outbreak is occurring in a rural area may make it harder to get resources there, but it also makes it harder for the virus to spread."" THIS IS A GLOBAL NEWS",deadly marburg virus outbreak declared in uganda

allison schmitt is the co-captain of the usa olympic swimming team at the 2016 rio games. THIS IS A GLOBAL NEWS THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Washington D.C.","(cnn) imagine that swimming is what you've loved for more than 15 years, but whenever you dive into the pool, you feel like a disappointment, unmotivated to go forward. the feeling is almost destructive. that was what was going on in allison schmitt 's mind during training after the 2012 london olympic games.

it hasn't always been that way.

to schmitt, swimming is a lifestyle, not a responsibility. even when she felt stressed, she wouldn't see swimming as a burden. instead, she looked at it as something fun.

""it's what keeps me going,"" she said.

in and out of the pool, schmitt keeps a positive attitude. she prefers to be a happy person, not the downer. ""laugh it off"" is her go-to coping mechanism.

jack bauerle, schmitt's coach at the university of georgia until 2013, has known her since 2005. he calls her a giver. ""sometimes, she puts her feelings in the back burner so that she could help others,"" bauerle said.

road to the olympics

a swimming career that would net eight olympic medals started when schmitt was 9. as ""the kid that wanted to [play] every sport,"" schmitt was a soccer player but didn't end up making the team. she decided to devote her athletic spirit and talents to the pool.

in fact, schmitt didn't quite like swimming at first; she was just following her older sister, kirsten. her fondness for swimming grew as she made friends on the team, and those relationships became an increasingly important part of her life.

growing up swimming, schmitt has always been disciplined. no matter how busy the training, she made sure that she finished schoolwork and didn't miss classes.

it was a surprise when she found out that she made the olympic team for the 2008 beijing games. she thought she wouldn't be qualified because she was the ""slow kid."" she didn't feel like she belonged on the team and even had a ""breakdown"" during the training camp.

winning a bronze medal in the 4x200-meter freestyle relay and almost making it to the 200-meter freestyle final during the games gave her confidence.

between 2008 and 2012, she trained as hard as she could while studying psychology at the university of georgia. before the london games, she took a year off from school to concentrate on preparing for the game.

her effort paid off: she hauled in three golds in the 2012 games.

the shadows of depression

the london olympics marked a high point in schmitt's swimming career. after that, depression crept in.

she became cranky and got irritated at minor problems. she remembered getting mad at not having the sports drink that she liked on the day of training and thinking, ""this is the worst day ever.""

she began to sleep more and more. when she entered the water, she didn't feel motivated, instead thinking she was a disappointment.

schmitt didn't want others to notice. all she wanted was for her team to achieve its goal and to do what she could as a good teammate.

""allison is the last person you would think that will get depressed,"" said bob bowman, schmitt's coach since 2006. ""she just has a bubbly, happy and smiling personality.""

he knew something was off when he got calls from a crying, upset schmitt after the london games.

her performance in the pool also tipped her off. ""the spirit wasn't there,"" said bauerle, schmitt's georgia swimming coach. ""you could just see the difference sometimes.""

bauerle thought it was just a passing phase, ""post-olympic blues."" but for schmitt, this ""phase"" lasted a little too long.

she had kept her struggles from friends and family. the hidden pains, however, didn't fool fellow olympic swimmer michael phelps, her surrogate brother.

in january 2015, schmitt was at what she calls the breaking point. she would dive into the water, thinking, ""oh, my gosh, i can't do this anymore."" she became angrier and more isolated. then phelps reached out, telling schmitt that he would be there to help if she needed anything. coaches and teammates also came to her aid.

seeing phelps go through his own mental health struggles, schmitt thought, if he said she would be able to push through, she could do the same. so she took his advice to seek help and started to see a psychologist that january.

""i started accepted the fact that i wanted to get help,"" said schmitt. ""it's ok to feel that way.""

bringing the darkness of depression to light

according to the national institute of mental health , depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the united states. in 2014, it is estimated that at least 6.7% of us adults had at least one depressive episode.

scott goldman , a sports psychologist at the university of michigan, said it is normal for some athletes to experience a sense of loss after the olympics.

""you give everything you have to something. when that something ends, it's significant,"" he said. ""for a lot of them, this is a roller coaster of excitement. ... it's a difficult transition from 'i am a swimmer' to 'i was a swimmer.' ""

to some, post-olympic blues can be just as hard to cope with as the death of a loved one or the end of a relationship, said goldman.

for a while, schmitt wasn't open about her psychological suffering. she thought that seeing a psychologist was an embarrassment and kept it from her family. it wasn't until her cousin, a young athlete named april bocian, ended her own life in may 2015 that schmitt decided to speak out.

""especially as athletes, we are taught that if we push through something, we can get through. we use that mentality in sports, and we use that in life,"" said schmitt. ""but life is such a big game. you need a whole army of support and help that you can get.""

by being outspoken about her own struggles, she hopes she'll inspire more people to recognize the severity of depression and the importance of seeking help.

now, schmitt has become more comfortable sharing her thoughts and emotions with the psychologist. she goes to her office whenever she needs someone to talk to. she's also considering pursuing a master's degree in social work to counsel those who are struggling with mental health problems.

allison schmitt is the co-captain of the usa olympic swimming team at the 2016 rio games. she won gold in the 4x200m freestyle relay final.

the changes are obvious. bowman and bauerle said they saw a much happier and more positive schmitt during the rio games, where she took home a gold medal and a silver.

bauerle thinks schmitt opening up about depression would be helpful to those who are going through similar struggles, especially athletes and their coaches.

""going back in time, i wish i had a better hold on her,"" said bauerle. ""she's giving service for coaches, to make sure that they are more aware. ... i think everybody's radar will be a little better for athletes.""

goldman, the sports psychologist, suggested that people close to athletes recognize post-performance phases as a natural part of the process, be mindful of the warning signs, and offer true and honest support.

unlike physical injuries, which can be seen in bandages, athletes' psychological struggles could often go unnoticed. goldman said that depending on the kind of sports, ""they might move at a slower pace; they might have trouble getting out of bed; they might have trouble getting engaged in tasks they did well before.""

focusing more on the olympians themselves and recognizing them as human beings, instead of their experience with the olympic games, is key to building authentic relationships and offering help, said goldman.

the oscar-winning actress and self-professed kardashian super fan was the guest host of ""jimmy kimmel live!"" on thursday, and she snagged her dream interview with kim kardashian west.

right out of the gate, lawrence hit a home run by asking the reality tv star about one of her famous exes, nfl player reggie bush.

""do you think it's a coincidence that reggie bush's wife looks just like you?"" lawrence asked. ""i don't.""

kardashian west laughed that one off, but the interview was off and running from there.

naked in kris jenner's closet

kardashian west recalled what happened when lawrence, admittedly ""obsessed"" with the kardashian-jenner clan for more than a decade, came over for dinner recently at mom kris jenner's house.

""i've never seen my mom more drunk in our lives,"" kardashian west said. ""it was so funny.""

lawrence apparently had her fair share, too, confessing she ""drank five martinis and wound up naked in (jenner's) closet.""

the actress said she just wanted a makeover from kardashian west and her fashion label-owning rapper-husband, kanye west.

""you said, 'i'm not joking. i really want kanye to style me and so i said, 'ok,' "" kardashian west said. ""i come back in and you're fully butt naked. i said, 'umm, i'm going to intercom downstairs and tell (kanye) not to come up.' ""

gasimus maximus, kimmy?

proving she was completely comfortable in her role as interviewer, lawrence got down to the personal.

""so do you and kanye fart in front of each other?"" she asked. ""do you talk about farts? like, do you fart in front of him?""

with a huge smile, kardashian west responded, ""i don't fart. what are you talking about?""

which sister lost her virginity first?

kardashian west thinks it was her. but she pointed out, ""i was in a serious relationship.""

dinner games

apparently the reality star had major sleuthing skills back in the day. she said she was the go-to person to hack into the voice mails of her friends' boyfriends to get all the dirt.

""so do you think that you could like hack a president's twitter (account) and maybe like stop a war?"" lawrence asked. ""like you could save the world?""

that question prompted kardashian west to remember a game they played at her mom's house. (see above regarding the alcohol consumed to figure out why lawrence said she didn't remember this particular story.)

""ok, if you could save the world who would you rather sleep with -- donald trump or kim jong un?"" kardashian west said they asked each other during the game. ""i think we were just laughing so hard we didn't choose.""

'we are super normal'

lawrence got her buddy to open up about how incredibly regular life can be in the kardashian west household.

""we are super normal,"" kardashian west said. ""we watch 'family feud' every night before we fall asleep.""

but her husband does have a weird habit, she confessed.

""he falls asleep anywhere,"" she said.

THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for San Diego","this essay is part of a column called the wisdom project by david allan, editorial director of cnn health and wellness. the series is on applying to one's life the wisdom and philosophy found everywhere, from ancient texts to pop culture. you can follow david at @davidgallan . don't miss another wisdom project column; subscribe here .

(cnn) have you ever asked yourself why you wanted (or want) to have children?

those who wrestled with the decision or struggled to conceive a child have probably thought about it a good deal. and some have always known the answer, maybe since they were kids themselves.

but for many parents and would-be parents, the question may seem odd or elementary -- which makes it a great question to tackle.

one answer is that we, as a species, harbor an evolutionary drive to propagate. our small part -- at its most basic, perhaps unconscious and even (by design) pleasurable level -- is to carry on our dna to the next generation. if enough of us do that (and we avoid destroying the planet), human beings will thrive.

another answer is simply social and cultural norms. the majority of the people you know, and most of those you don't, are doing it. this is why people who don't have kids often have an answer to ""why?"" at the ready: because everyone asks them. rarely, though, are parents asked what motivated them to have kids. there's little need to explain behavior that is typical and expected.

but even with evolutionary hardwiring and societal peer pressure as part of the equation, that usually doesn't fully explain the unique, individual drives that lead people to want to make other people.

whatever your reason, it says something important about you and about the kind of parent you are or hope to be. i think it's worth exploring.

you are the parenting expert you've been looking for

why did you decide to have children? why do you want one, or a second or third? what is it about your personal desires, history, influences and beliefs that led to such a major life decision? why spend so much time and money, and take on all that additional stress, anxiety and responsibility?

knowing why you got into this game can give you the insight needed to play it to the best of your ability. you are your own best guide to navigating the million and one parenting questions, conundrums and choices you will face from here on out.

historically, people have had children out of economic necessity, to work the farm, for example. conversely, children can be symbols of prosperity. they can be a reflection of yourself or a vessel for your own wishes and goals. or parenting can be a noble act of sacrifice for the greater good.

pete seeger is credited with this sweet answer: ""we do it for the high wages ... kisses.""

when i asked friends and family this question, it was interesting to see how some knew their answers right away while others stared off in the distance with a puzzled look on their faces, as if they'd never pondered it before.

here's a taste:

re-create my own childhood joys

grow and share familial love

make myself a better person

start my own family after being on my own for a long time

add to a greater sense of life's purpose

fit in and meet society's expectations

because kids are fun to hang out with and talk to

help make the world a better place

be a better parent than i had

a spiritual call to action

repay what i owe my parents

give in to a biological urge

cultivate a strong relationship with my kids so they remain a part of my life after they move out

my wife had her answer at the ready: ""i wanted to feel the intense love a parent has for a child."" it's a desire she's had since she was a young girl.

as i began to tell her my reason, i saw a nervous look on her face.

""i feel like we should have had this conversation before we had kids,"" she said, cutting me off. ""what if i don't think your answer is a good one?""

""too late,"" i said.

my reasoning lies in the high premium i put on experience: travel. film. reading. writing. storytelling. humor. food and drink (more drink than food). spirituality. nature.

being a parent is a unique experience. i am aware of the missed adventures and career options i might have pursued were it not for my two daughters. but still, being their father comes out far ahead.

i also hubristically thought i'd be very good at parenting. there's a part of me that wanted to improve upon my own upbringing. since i was a kid, i'd been convinced i would be an amazing father.

that was, of course, before i became one. parenting, it turns out, is humbling in the way it exposes your insecurities and personality flaws. i'm getting better, and i try to live up to that potential, but i routinely fall short -- which every parent can relate to.

put your answer to good use

""mindful parenting"" is one of the most enlightened trends in the history of parenting techniques. it's about being present with your children but also better understanding your motivations and feelings while parenting. getting in touch with your motivation for becoming a parent gives you a perspective too often lacking at difficult parenting moments.

my answer, about wanting these unique and varied parenting experiences, has helped me embrace a wider spectrum of them. it's easy to revel in a bear hug or a shared laugh, but i'm extending that love of experience for more challenging moments, such getting screamed at in the middle of a bath time. staying present and connected to whatever is going on when i'm with my daughters gives them more of the attention they need from me and makes meaningful moments more frequent and poignant.

your own answer to the question is something of a parental compass needle too, pointing the way when you are unsure how to parent in a given situation.

get back to the roots of your parenting motivation. it could impact how you respond to frustrating moments, how you spend your weekends, what behavior you model and how you talk to your children about life.

the very last boeing 747 passenger jet was likely delivered in july -- a jumbo for korean air lines -- and on november 7, 2017 united airlines is retiring its boeing 747 fleet with a retro-themed farewell flight from san francisco to honolulu.

the 747 has been a passenger favorite since being introduced in 1970 by fondly remembered airline pan american world airways. it's doubled as a flying white house as air force one, as well as being the setting for many a hollywood airborne adventure.

related content why the sun is setting on the boeing 747

there are close to 500 of the big planes still flying, although many airlines are now replacing their passenger 747s with larger, more advanced, and more efficient twin-engine planes.

the most recent version of ""the queen of the skies"" is the 747-8 intercontinental, with new wings, engines, and technologies unimaginable to the designers and pilots of the original 747, which debuted almost 50 years ago.

while its unique silhouette will still be around for years to come -- albeit in fewer and fewer numbers -- there's little doubt that the ""queen's"" impact on aviation is as big as its size.

the first wide-body

the 747 ushered in the era of the twin-aisle, wide-body passenger plane. but had it been up to pan am's founder, juan trippe, the celebrated jet might have been a double-deck version of the single-aisle boeing 707.

trippe pushed the plane's designers to come up with a double-decker, a shape that boeing engineer joe sutter, known as the ""father of the 747,"" called a ""turkey.""

it took a boeing executive's initiative in a meeting in a pan am boardroom to change trippe's mind. the dimensions of the room were exactly the same as the proposed wide-body 747's width and height, and pan am was impressed.

the interior of the 747 was developed in association with the seattle-based firm teague, boeing's long-time cabin design partner.

it was the first plane to have almost vertical sidewalls and a high ceiling, giving passengers a feeling of space and openness.

instead of a long, thin tube, the cabin was split up into ""rooms,"" with galleys and lavatories installed as dividers.

it's a shape that has defined long-haul travel for nearly half a century.

the 747 swiftly garnered a reputation as a glamorous transport option. boeing

up-sized airports

the 747's dimensions were huge compared to the 707s and douglas dc-8s that were the mainstay of airlines' international fleets in the 1960s.

with hundreds of passengers arriving and departing on every jumbo jet, airports had to quickly adapt, with expanded boarding lounges, check-in counters, and terminals.

every international airline wanted to have the prestige of flying a 747, meaning that existing customs and immigration areas were soon overwhelmed with multiple, simultaneous arrivals of the big plane.

ground-support equipment had to grow, too. aircraft tugs got a lot bigger, to handle the 747's prodigious weight of over 750,000 pounds. catering trucks were modified to reach the cabin doors far above the ramp, and refueling tankers now had to stretch to reach the underside of the massive wings.

fabulous freight-hauler

the 747 was designed at a time when the airline industry expected the supersonic transport -- sst for short -- to be the aircraft of the future.

the world's first supersonic transport aircraft, the soviet-designed tupolev tu-144, had made its maiden flight in 1968 and the anglo-french concorde took to the air two months later.

experts in the 1960s predicted that the 747 would have a short lifetime as a passenger jet, eventually giving way to aircraft traveling at multiple times the speed of sound. so the 747's designers tried to future-proof the jumbo by engineering it to carrying cargo.

the main deck of the 747 was sized about 20 feet wide, to handle two standard cargo containers. to make loading easier, the nose of the cargo model of the 747 opened and pivoted upwards.

that meant that the cockpit had to be located above the main deck, giving the queen its distinctive hump just behind the flight deck. what was originally envisioned as a crew rest area in that space became the jet's most renowned feature, the passenger lounge. only in later versions did that upper deck get stretched to accommodate a large seating area.

as it turned out, the boeing sst project -- the 2707 -- was canceled in 1971, the tupolev tu-144 was permanently grounded after only 55 scheduled flights, and concorde made its final flight nearly 15 years ago.

as for the hardy 747, more than 1,500 of them have been manufactured over the past half-century.

boeing is cool on the future of the 747 as a passenger plane, but it wants to build the cargo version of the 747-8 in the years to come.

the new big fan

new airplanes and new engines are created at the same time. new aircraft designers might seek to consume less fuel, generate more power, and take advantage of lighter-weight designs from engine developers.

the 747 needed a huge jump in engine power and efficiency to get the massive plane in the air, and make money for the airlines. pratt & whitney changed the shape of jet engines forever with their jt9d turbofans for the 747. the engine differed from earlier power plants by having a huge fan at the front.

an enormous amount of air is forced into the engine, but only a small portion goes into the engine's core where it is compressed, mixed with fuel and ignited to drive the turbine. the internal turbine spins the huge fan, pushing the jet forward.

with most of the air flow directed around -- rather than through -- the core of the engine, it was the first ""high-bypass"" turbofan of the jet age.

the design makes the engine quieter, more powerful, and with better fuel efficiency. and instead of the scream of earlier generation jets, the 747 ""buzzed"" when it took off.

the 747 might have been the first, but now every passenger jet is powered by an incredibly reliable and sophisticated high-bypass turbofan engine.

the real game-changer?

the 747 went into service in the early 1970s, at a time of major societal change. it drove exponential growth in air travel, tourism, and connections between people around the world. in its first year, a fully-loaded 747 cut the cost of flying a passenger by half. flying became instantly more accessible.

but maybe the award for the biggest change in air travel should go to the 747's older sibling, the 707. that smooth-flying, jet-powered pioneer was a quantum leap from the ""piston-pounders"" that preceded it. it connected continents in mere hours and showed the world the power of jet travel.

brien wygle, the co-pilot on the 747's first flight, and boeing's former vice president of flight operations, certainly thinks so.

""the shorter flight times, the higher altitudes, the better pressurization -- a lot of things we brought out with the 707 were revolutionary,"" he tells cnn travel.

for far too long, naked women have become such a staple in tv and film that it's hard to notice, much less quantify, the inequality unfolding right before our eyes. but a recent study from mount saint mary's university did just that and found that actresses are almost three times as likely as their male counterparts to be required to strip to their unmentionables.

raval davis

undoubtedly, female nudity has become an accomplice to get viewers through bad plotlines and awkward acting. and sometimes it's just the cherry atop the box office sundae. but why is female nudity so much more ubiquitous than male nudity? and what does this say about the role of women in the world?

according to a 2005 university of pennsylvania study , 57% of us teenagers, ages 14 to 16, identified television, film and other media as the primary source of information about sex and gender. in a post-#imwithher era, are we really still ok with such widespread and normalized objectification of the female body?

but it's not only an issue for the viewer. it's an even larger issue for the actress being asked to display her body. as a new actress trying my best to break into episodic television, i have to admit i cringe every time i read those typical female character breakdowns. you know the ones: the waitress in the club who has no more than five lines but happens to have sex with the main male character. she's totally inconsequential to the plot but helps move the episode along somehow. and, of course, nudity required or must be ok with nudity is bolded at the bottom of the script. it's degrading but seemingly sometimes a necessary evil for actresses to make their way above the five-line mark.

that's according to security researcher nitesh dhanjani, who spoke about his findings at a recent hacker conference in singapore. all it takes is cracking a six-character password, considered low-hanging fruit in the cyber security world.

and if it can happen to a tesla (tsla), other cars may also be susceptible. after all, many modern cars made by others like ford (f) and toyota (tm) can also be controlled via computer and mobile phone apps and come equipped with wireless connections that tap into wi-fi, bluetooth or cell phone networks.

""we can't attempt to secure our vehicles the way we have attempted to secure our workstations at home,"" dhanjani, who advises companies on computer security, said in a blog post. ""the implications to physical security and privacy in this context have raised stakes to the next level.""

related story: tesla and audi to become at&t cars

dhanjani was especially worried about teslas.

tesla owners must create a password-protected online account, which lets them use a smartphone app to access car locks, locate a car, and also see how much its batteries are charged. a single password gives complete access to an account, which is a problem, according to dhanjani.

he also found that tesla's website didn't lock users out even if someone typed several incorrect passwords. that opens up the site to what's known as ""brute-force attacks,"" where a computer tries thousands of passwords per second until it breaks in. on monday afternoon, tesla updated its requirements, locking out users after five incorrect attempts, dhanjani said. tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

dhanjani learned about this firsthand when he bought his own tesla model s p85+ three weeks ago. he noticed the single password requirements, and decided to test the system by submitting a wrong password 150 times straight. it never locked him out, nor did it ask for the jumbled letters that keeps automated hacker attacks at bay.

the race to the top has just gotten tighter, with two rising mega-towers in the middle east battling to become the world's tallest.

construction has now begun on the tower at dubai creek harbor , a vast waterfront development, with completion scheduled for ahead of dubai's expo 2020 world fair, which kicks off in october that year.

piercing through a canopy of clouds, the tower, at 3,045ft (928m), aims to take the title of world's tallest tower, which the 2,723ft-tall (830m) burj khalifa , also in dubai, has held since 2010.

but it's got competition. the jeddah tower , in saudi arabia, is also slated to finish in 2020.

when completed, this gleaming vertical will be 236ft (72m) taller than dubai's creation.

if the tower in dubai wants the world title, even for a short time, it has to open its doors before the jeddah tower.

the tower will be the heart of dubai creek harbour, one of the largest tourist and lifestyle developments in the world stretching across 2.3 square miles (6 sqkm). credit: emaar properties

ready, steady, go!

both of these towers are feats in modern engineering.

the tower , in dubai, is being constructed by emaar, the real estate giant also behind the burj khalifa, and will anchor the dubai creek development, serving -- developers hope -- as a magnet for tourists.

designed by swiss-spanish architect santiago calatrava valls , it will feature the pinnacle room -- an observation point offering 360-degree views of the emirate -- and public vertical gardens, while 18 to 20 floors have been reserved for homes, restaurants, shops and a boutique hotel.

if construction runs to schedule, this $1 billion tower will have been thrown up in just three years.

the jeddah tower, in saudi arabia, will have taken a little longer.

construction on this graceful arrow to the sky began on april 1, 2013, and was originally slated for completion in 2018, but its opening date has already been pushed back twice. constructing it will require about 5.7 million square feet of concrete and 80,000 tons of steel, according to the saudi gazette



























































1 / 30 – twisting tall towers of the world 'the eleventh' towers in new york will stand 300 and 400 feet tall on completion in 2019. the towers will join a growing field of twisted architecture that is making waves around the world.

but to think dubai could finish first is not ""as farfetched as it sounds"", according to jason gabel, communications manager for the council on tall buildings and urban habitat (ctbuh).

""the dubai project is an observation tower, and therefore won't require nearly as much lead time as a full-blown skyscraper,"" gabel tells cnn. ""2020 is a real possibility for completion.""

because less than 50% of the tower's height is occupied by usable floor space, it is defined by the ctbuh as a ""supported tower"" rather than a ""building"".

this technicality precludes the tower from achieving the distinction of being the world's tallest building. rather, it would be the world's tallest man-made structure, or tower, until the jeddah tower is completed.

the power of a skyline

home to more than 65 highrises over 656 feet (200m) tall and counting, dubai has become synonymous with futuristic skyscrapers, and has been a pioneer of this in the middle east.

""historically, no middle eastern country has come close to building skyscrapers at the rate and height of the united arab emirates (uae), but notable pockets of high-rise development are occurring in qatar, israel, and saudi arabia,"" says gabel. ""the competitive situation we now see between saudi arabia and the uae very unique.""

dubai's lofty intentions debuted in 1979, with the 39-story dubai world trade center. it was the city's first high rise, and the tallest building in the middle east.

subsequent iconic buildings, such as the burj khalifa and the burj al arab , have given dubai global notoriety.

burj al arab credit: courtesy burj al arab

""height produces iconicity and visibility on a global stage,"" says gabel, explaining why dubai has focused on building big. ""visibility is itself an asset that can have a positive impact on real estate valuation, investment flows, tourism numbers, and public identity.

""put simply, structures like this are very expensive upfront, but the benefits of having the 'tallest' are often worth the trouble -- as was the case with the burj khalifa.""

aric chen, the design and architecture curator m+ visual culture museum in hong kong, tells cnn that for emerging economies a skyline can be a powerful communications tool.

""these soaring profiles are in many ways symbolic,"" chen tells cnn.

""places like dubai and, to some extent, places like china, are still trying to put themselves on the map and prove that they have arrived as modern global and technologically advanced nations.""

testing the tower

the rapid speed at which dubai can throw up a mega-tower has not, however, escaped criticism.

a series of fires in the past few years, including a blaze that tore through a luxury skyscraper on the palm jumeirah artificial island in dubai this month -- have called into question the quality of some towers, and their fire-proofing.

""super tall buildings are not unproblematic and there are safety concerns,"" says chen.

valls, however, is confident that the tower will not succumb to such issues.

""extensive studies were undertaken in preparation for the ground breaking, and the learning that we have gained from the experience will add to the knowledge base of mankind,"" he said in a statement.

developers have installed multiple damper and shock absorption systems throughout the building, to ensure its stability.

they also completed a series of wind tunnel, climate and seismic tests analyzing 12 scenarios across varying heights to check the behavior of the building under stressful conditions.

""we need to have a balanced and careful look at skyscrapers,"" says chen. ""but they do serve to again push technologies, and push what's possible.

""we can certainly learn from that experimentation."" THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Austin",tower at dubai creek harbour joins race to be world's tallest building

color film was rare in world war ii. the vast majority of the photos taken during the conflict were in black and white, and color photography as a whole was still a relatively new technique.

it's this fact that makes the photos from a new book published by imperial war museums so mesmerizing. they are in their original state -- not retouched, not colorized: ""you are seeing exactly what was taken. i know it's common these days to see retouched photographs and colorized black & white photos, but this is the real deal,"" said the book's author ian carter during a phone interview.

the images were commissioned by the british ministry of information, which got hold of a very small quantity of kodachrome film. they then decided to use it experimentally, by giving it to some of their official photographers who took it to several locations and employed it very sparingly.

only about 3,000 images were taken in total, but not everything has survived: ""about half of them went missing and we don't know where they went,"" said carter. the surviving photos became part of the museum's archives in 1949, and some of them are being published for the first time in 70 years.

the photos were commissioned to publish in american magazines, which were printed in color, but not all of them would have been published during the war.

it's not entirely clear how the film was allocated to photographers, but it's likely they were taken as ""special"" shots along with regular black and white cameras: ""they had a very limited amount of film and had to be very careful, therefore they must have had the film in a separate camera and used it for a couple of photos while taking black and white shots,"" said carter.

some amazing details that would be lost in greyscale suddenly emerge, such as the orange accents -- the color of the dutch royal family -- in a scene of liberation in eindhoven, netherlands.

colorized photos or footage from world war ii have been around for some time, but these images truly show the world as people would have seen it at the time: ""when you see them, they look almost like they were taken yesterday or reenacted,"" said carter.

THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Phoenix","(cnn) with the june arrival of their twins , actor george clooney, 55, and his wife, human rights lawyer amal clooney, 39, reignited a conversation about what it means to be an older dad.

despite growing awareness of in-vitro fertilization and aging mothers -- such as janet jackson, who gave birth in january at 50 -- some of the science and social impacts of aging fathers are less clear. but that isn't deterring hopeful dads from growing their families.

""it's very well-documented: men are having children later into life,"" said dr. mary samplaski , a male-fertility specialist at keck medicine of the university of southern california. ""it's become so much more mainstream.""

men's fertility does not drop as sharply as women's as they age, said samplaski; many can have biological children long after they're old and gray without the need for technology to intervene. but some of samplaski's patients have questions about the risks of fathering later in life.

ivf success and struggle

one risk for older would-be dads is the potential success of in vitro fertilization, a medical procedure where the woman's egg is fertilized by a man's sperm in a test tube and then introduced into her womb.

among couples requiring ivf to conceive a baby, the likelihood of a live birth is reduced with a father's increasing age, according to a new study presented at a medical conference recently. this is the first study to show that the father's age is a factor in ivf success.

harvard researchers analyzed nearly 19,000 ivf cycles performed for 7,753 couples at a boston area reproductive center between 2000 and 2014. after stratifying the female and male participants into age groups, they compared the ages to successful births.

live birth rates were lowest in couples where the female partner was between ages 40 and 42, the researchers discovered. in these circumstances, the male partner's age, whether old or young, did not impact the results. however, when the female was younger than 40, the likelihood of a live birth declined with the increasing age of the male partner.

for example, a woman under 30 partnered with a man between 40 and 42 years old suffered lower birth rates (46%) than same-aged women whose partners were between the ages of 30 and 35. paired with a younger man, nearly three out of four of these young women successfully gave birth.

the same was true even among women in the next older age group, between 35 and 40. in these cases, women whose partners were under 30 experienced a nearly 30% improvement in their odds of a successful birth compared to women paired with men between age 30 and 35, the authors said.

knowing the risks

swedish study in 2014 added to the evidence that dads older than 45 are more likely to have children with schizophrenia, autism and other psychiatric disorders. still, even for these fathers, the absolute risk was found to be very low -- well below 1% for certain conditions.

for one man who saw the study, the findings pushed him into action.

""i reported on a big study that came out in 2014, and i thought a lot about it, and a few months later, i went and banked my own sperm,"" former cnn producer william hudson said in august.

""i banked my sperm because i wanted to have the option of using younger sperm later in life.""

to explain the link between mental illness and paternal age, researchers have pointed to the mutations that accumulate in sperm dna as men get older, which may be inherited by their sons and daughters.

there are no genetic tests for psychiatric illnesses such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, samplaski said.

however, last year, another study in nature genetics took an opposing view: spontaneous mutations in sperm dna were not largely to blame for the increased risk of psychiatric illness. the researchers found that genes might contribute to this risk, but only a small portion of it -- about 10% to 20%.

a closer look at the data shows that mental illness isn't just linked to older fathers; there's a risk among younger fathers , too. some researchers say the focus on mutations could be a red herring. according to the authors of the nature genetics study, fathers with a heritable mental illness may simply be more likely to have children at the extremes of age -- perhaps because they socialize or take risks differently.

though a similar trend has been found for iq scores, other studies have refuted those results by taking into account paternal intelligence.

a number of other conditions have been linked to late fatherhood. one of the most common is a type of dwarfism called achondroplasia, for which there is a genetic test. for men over 50, the risk of achondroplasia is only slightly more common than 1 in 2,000 births.

however, no strong data exist to suggest that children of older parents actually live longer. some doctors have proposed that aging sperm may come with a benefit: longer telomeres . telomeres are the tips of chromosomes that protect dna while it's being copied -- like the aglet at the end of a shoelace that prevents it from fraying. many scientists believe that longer telomeres signify longevity.however, no strong data exist to suggest that children of older parents actually live longer.

samplaski said the risks that concern her patients are not always genetic. for many, it's a simple numbers game.

""if you're 55 when you have this baby, you're going to be 65 when this kid is 10,"" she said, adding that people's numerical age may not always be the best predictor of their life expectancy.

""most of the couples that are having babies later in life are taking care of themselves.""

too old for this?

""i got tons of blowback about it,"" said freelance writer and television producer philip lerman, who has written about his decision to become a father at 46.

after the clooneys' news spread on social media, some on twitter compared george clooney to a grandfather. lerman said the reactions he received mirrored that.

in one humans of new york photo that drew more than 70,000 responses, a young woman with a 78-year-old father said that it's ""hard to be this young and watch them go that way already.""

while some children of older parents commented about the difficulties caring for sick and aging parents, others spoke of the valuable lessons they had learned from parents with more life experience.

another story that drew strong responses was a 2011 new york magazine cover story featuring a white-haired model who was digitally altered to look pregnant placed next to the headline, ""is she just too old for this?"" in response to the article, which addressed both men and women, some readers called out aging parents for being ""selfish,"" lamented not having grandparents in the picture and expressed worry about older parents' mortality.

lerman, now 61, has a 14-year-old son named max, whom he and his wife conceived using a donor egg. people told lerman he was ""too old"" to have a child for many of these reasons. some suggested that he would have trouble keeping up with a kid and that he might put his future son at risk for genetic diseases.

""i took a chance on having ... a child with problems,"" lerman said, adding that it's important to think about the alternative.

""what if i had listened to them?"" he added. ""what if ... max didn't exist, and he didn't get to play little league, and he didn't get to be the star in the school play last year?""

lerman admits that he ""can't do the things that a younger man can"" but said children like max benefit from parents who have taken time to become more emotionally and financially stable. where some have criticized his age, lerman believes that older parents are just one manifestation of the diverse american family.

THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for San Antonio","pyongyang, north korea (cnn) north korean officials were closely watching us president donald trump when he addressed the south korean national assembly wednesday , but they say they weren't listening.

though the american leader's tone was more subdued -- and he proposed what some perceived as a conditional olive branch -- officials in pyongyang authorized to speak for the government told cnn when it comes to trump, ""we don't care about what that mad dog may utter because we've already heard enough.""

pyongyang accuses trump and the united states of heightening tensions to a level not seen since the korean war ended in an armistice in 1953. they say it's actions not words that matter, pointing to three us aircraft carriers and a submarine currently off the coast of the korean peninsula.

""the united states is threatening us with nuclear aircraft carriers and strategic bombers. they are challenging us with with the most vicious and demeaning provocations but we will counter those threats by bolstering the power of justice in order to take out the root cause of aggression and war,"" the officials said.

trump did hint at a chance of diplomacy to resolve the standoff, but only if north korea were to stop its provocative behavior, quit developing ballistic missiles, and agree to ""complete, verifiable, and total"" denuclearization. most korea-watchers believe that last item is a non-starter.

""the prospect of the north koreans actually denuclearizing is near zero,"" said michael hayden, a former head of the cia and the nsa. ""they are not irrational in this regard, they've seen what happens to states who have given up their nuclear programs and they're trying to hold on to this as a matter of regime survival.""

adam mount, a senior fellow at the federation of american scientists, told cnn he was particularly concerned that trump sees north korea giving up its nuclear weapons as a starting point, not an end of the negotiating process.

""he held to the same old insistence on complete, verifiable denculearization, without a plan to get there, which we didn't hear,"" mount said. ""that insistence will prevent any kind of forward progress.""

why north korea wants nukes and missiles north korea has long maintained it wants nuclear weapons and long-range missiles to deter the united states from attempting to overthrow the regime of kim jong un. pyongyang looks at states such as iraq -- where saddam hussein was overthrown by the united states -- and libya -- its late leader, moammar gadhafi, gave up his nuclear ambitions for sanctions relief and aid, only to be toppled and killed after the united states intervened in his country's civil unrest -- and believes that only being able to threaten the us mainland with a retaliatory nuclear strike can stop american military intervention. many experts say they believe north korea would not use the weapons first. kim values his regime's survival above all else and knows the use of a nuclear weapon would start a war he could not win, analysts say.

the audiences

though trump stood before south korean lawmakers, his audience was likely more global.

""it was a tough speech,"" said hayden. ""it wasn't over the top, it wasn't beyond the edge. no rocket man and no fire and fury , no over-posturing about imminent action on the part of the united states. now, that said, he didn't point out an obvious off-ramp, as to how we get out of the circumstances that we're in.""

that may have not gone over well in the national assembly chambers, where many politicians are concerned about the potential of a catastrophic conflict.

""trump refrained from making really aggressive military threats and that will be appreciated in seoul. the text of his speech really illustrated the historical and moral struggle going on on the korean peninsula, sometimes in very evocative terms. i think the korean people will appreciate that too,"" said mount.

""but the reality tonight is that we didn't get anything different from a strategic patience,"" he said, referring to president barack obama's north korea policy that the trump administration has declared is over.

james clapper, the former us director of national intelligence, described the speech as ""mostly stick and not much carrot.""

clapper called the speech ""strong"" and said he didn't believe it was likely to intimidate the north koreans, but was surprised by the laundry list of human rights abuses.

""i wished he'd expanded more in his press conference remarks about a deal and offered something, a path to negotiation,"" he told cnn.

but victor cha, a former us diplomat involved in the six party talks and a rumored pick for the next us ambassador to south korea, said on twitter those expecting a public airing of the administration's plans shouldn't hold their breath.

""i would not expect a us president to lay out specific quid pro quos in a public speech,"" cha tweeted. ""he sent a direct public message to kju (kim jong un), for diplomacy, which is more than anyone would have expected.""

though trump avoided the fiery rhetoric and name-calling that he's employed when previously discussing north korea and its leader, kim jong un, the address will likely still rub pyongang's most powerful the wrong way.

he called life in the hermit nation ""a hell that no person deserves"" and said the country has committed crimes ""against god and man.""

""you don't go so overboard in insulting and attacking your adversary if you want to get into some kind of negotiation,"" said john delury, a professor at yonsei university's graduate school of international relations.

""it's one thing to bring human rights into the equation. it's another to spend the majority of the speech detailing the brutality of the north korean state,"" delury told cnn on the phone from seoul after attending the speech. ""what the south koreans were looking for in the speech is reassurance that trump will be moderate and that the alliance is strong but he's not going to precipitate military action.""

after listing alleged abuses committed by the north korean regime, trump questioned why nations would continue to support pyongyang. it was likely an implicit stab at beijing, the next stop on the us president's nearly two week-long trip.

china accounts for about 90% of north korea's trade, a vital lifeline for north korea's small and sealed-off economy.

""messaging to the chinese and the russians about severing relationships, i'm not sure what that means,"" said clapper, the former us director of national intelligence.

""the chinese are going to be hard-pressed to do that. the greater strategic imperative for the chinese is that north korea not implode,"" he said.

intelligence experts and analysts believe beijing's biggest concern is that a collapsed north korea could lead to a unified and us-allied korea on china's border and a mass migration of refugees across the yalu river.

in 2000 trump proposed banning private ownership of assault weapons and increasing the waiting period for the purchase of guns. THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Washington D.C.","michael d'antonio is the author of the new book ""never enough: donald trump and the pursuit of success"" (st. martin's press). the opinions expressed in this commentary are his.

(cnn) having long ago committed himself to the proposition that there is no such thing as too much press, donald trump may be the most photographed, filmed and quoted man of our time.

add his own words, offered in books, speeches, facebook posts and tweets, and you might conclude that there's little left for this man to share.

but think again. what if all those words were intended, not to reveal, but conceal? what if trump talks so much because he wants to control the conversation?

now that trump is the gop's presumptive nominee for president, he'll face more intense scrutiny about his many claims to personal success, his political beliefs, his temperament and his character. in each case, the public record is filled with incidents and examples, but a skeptic finds little clarity.

this state of affairs may suffice for anyone buying a steak or an apartment from trump the salesman, but voters contemplating trump the candidate for president deserve better answers to the lingering questions.

here they are:

what is trump's temperament?

tv audiences have been treated to more than 100 episodes of trump's reality tv shows ""the apprentice"" and ""celebrity apprentice."" the trump depicted on air is the product of so much editing and consulting by producers and directors that it is no better than a cartoon. more useful is the cumulative trump record, which includes as many negatives as positives.

to trump's credit, he has shown himself to be resilient, coming back from failures that would have sent less confident men and women into business exile. most notable, of course, is the crisis he experienced in the early 1990s when he was unable to pay personal and corporate debts in the neighborhood of $3.4 billion

trump is also a nimble entrepreneur, who looks for opportunities and seizes them decisively. witness his ability to deal in real estate, entertainment and retail merchandising, all at the same time.

on the other side of the ledger, open questions remain about his consistent record of cruelty and excess when dealing with critics and competitors. trump's code begins with the belief that he's justified in ""hitting back ten times harder"" whenever he's offended. if our presidents believed in this approach, america would have engaged in shooting wars with untold numbers of countries that have, in recent decades, committed transgressions against the united states.

would trump have hit back 10 times harder when north korea detained the spy ship pueblo? what about the downing of malaysia airlines flight 17 over the territory of our ally ukraine. u.s. intelligence indicates a russia missile likely was responsible. would trump have responded by downing 10 aeroflot planes?

we can ask additional questions about trump's penchant for bullying. in some cases this trait has shown itself in mere words, as he has attempted to humiliate, disparage and marginalize others. in other instances he has sought to force innocent landowners off their properties to make way for his developments. this willingness to use any means necessary to get what he wants raises serious concern about trump's ability to manage america's affairs in a complex world.

what does trump believe?

more than any political figure in modern times, trump represents an ideological puzzle. although he now claims the conservative republican mantle, he has often associated himself with liberal and democratic party ideas. in 1999 he told cnn, ""i've actually been an activist democrat and republican.""

in the past, trump said he is ""totally pro-choice."" now he is against abortion rights, recently musing about punishing women who might violate a ban on the procedure.

in the past, trump was in favor of levying a big tax on the rich , himself included, to pay down the federal deficit. like banks, rich people have the money, and trump reasoned that they could afford to help the country out. today, trump is in favor of big tax cuts for the wealthy.

in 2000 trump proposed banning private ownership of assault weapons and increasing the waiting period for the purchase of guns. in the current campaign he has declared himself to be an ardent defender of gun rights, and he has even proposed eliminating gun-free zones near schools.

the list of trump flip-flops is long and includes his positions on the wars in iraq and afghanistan and his regard for hillary clinton's performance as secretary of state. voters, especially those conservatives who want a clear sense of what their standard-bearer will do as president, deserve explanations for these shifts.

how rich is he?

throughout his life trump has cited his wealth as evidence of his excellence but without offering verifiable proof of his claims. in the 1970s he cruised manhattan in a chauffeured limousine and gave others the impression that he was in control of the $200 million fortune amassed by his father.

in the 1980s, when he first made it onto the forbes magazine list of america's wealthiest men and women, trump complained often and loudly about how his holdings were underestimated. more recently he said he is worth some $10 billion.

the record produced by those who have looked closely at trump's finances raises many questions. writer wayne barrett reported in the 1980s that trump's income as of 1978 was less than $100,000. in the 1993 biography of trump called ""lost tycoon,"" harry hurt iii noted that during his divorce from his first wife, ivana, her attorneys found that trump had never been worth the billions of dollars he claimed. hurt also reported that in march 1992, trump's own lawyers said he could not afford to pay ivana even half of the $20 million he had offered as a settlement.

more recently doubts about his wealth arose in 2005 when journalist tim o'brien wrote that trump was probably worth between $150 million and $250 million. for a man who reveled in his image as a billionaire, o'brien's estimate was too much to bear. trump sued. the case was dismissed by the trial judge. trump appealed. he lost

were trump a more circumspect and well-mannered man, who never bragged about how rich he is, his wealth would be less of an issue. however trump has made his fortune such an important part of his identity that voters deserve to know the truth. many of the facts are contained in trump's personal income tax filings, and it is now a campaign tradition for candidates to make these documents public. clinton has made public all of her returns going back to 2000.

so far, trump has refused to release his returns because, he says, he is undergoing an audit on returns filed in the last few years. nothing in the law, or in federal regulations, would prohibit him from making the documents public now, but if he is uncomfortable with releasing those forms, he could simply match clinton for those years that are settled.

such a release would reassure the public that trump is who he says he is -- a really rich man -- and allow a glimpse into other matters, including his charitable giving. it is a matter of conservative orthodoxy that the rich should be spared excessive taxation so they can support society freely with their philanthropy.

is he a man of character?

personality, which can be seen in a smile, heard in a glib remark or felt when viewing a performance, is not the most important measure of a man or woman. many people with winning personalities are, in fact, hucksters, con men, manipulators and deceivers. in fact, the false signals flashed by well-practiced performers, including politicians, compel us to look for the signs of the character beneath the personality.

experts in assessing character generally look for some traits such as autonomy and life purpose that trump clearly possesses in abundance. but there are other areas of character , including positive relations with others, ethical behavior, empathy, honesty and humility where trump would not achieve a very high score.

in his long and very public life, trump has often shown he is willing to do things others consider wrong in order to get what he wants. this includes using a false identity to make claims about his success, carrying out a bitter divorce dispute in the tabloid press, criticizing the appearance of others and refusing to take the high road when offered the chance.

the most troubling aspect of trump's character can be seen in his devotion to the so-called birther campaign that sought to delegitimize president barack obama. despite all the evidence to the contrary, birthers led by trump insisted that some mystery surrounded obama's status as a citizen born in the united states.

long after documents were produced to settle this falsely posed question, trump continued to raise doubts and thus signal his allegiance to those who considered the president to be an unworthy ""other."" the racism latent in the birther movement was documented in a study by university of delaware psychologist eric heyman, but the link to prejudice was always plain to see. rather than stand against birtherism, trump built a following by exploiting it.

in fact, one can find precedent for trump's birtherism in his previous provocative statements about racially sensitive subjects. other evidence of his character can be found in his selective use of facts, his tendency to inflame conflict rather than cool it and his devotion to self-promotion.

in the past trump's character has been well-suited to his pursuit of success as he defines it. but as revealed thus far, it would disqualify him when it comes to the presidency. we can only hope trump has something better to show and will do it when placed under the pressure of the coming campaign.

it sounded like a good ideathe idea of a four-day workweek is not new.
based on these positive results, utah's governor enacted a mandatory four-day workweek for all state employees. THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for San Diego","many employers and employees love the thought of a four-day workweek . supposedly, a four-day work schedule allows workers extra time to pursue leisure activities and family togetherness. spurred on by visions of spending more time at the beach, many people are now encouraging businesses to adopt this kind of work plan.

there are many purported advantages . some authorities say that a four-day work schedule facilitates the ability to provide child care and assistance for the elderly.

proponents of such ""compressed"" work schedules -- those in which employees work longer hours for fewer days of the week --- point to gains in productivity that result from decreased overhead costs , such as not having to keep the lights on when nobody is working. additional cost savings can be obtained from reducing total weekly commuting time

a variety of business have tested the four-day concept, including amazon, google, deloitte and a host of smaller firms. amazon announced in late august that it is experimenting with an even shorter workweek of 30 hours for select employees, who would earn 75 percent of their full-time salary, should they choose to opt in.

many of the pilot programs have shown promising results. statistics from the society for human resource management indicate that 31 percent of employees were in a compressed workweek schedule as of 2015. that's the case, however, for only 5 percent of large companies.

this is an issue in which i have considerable experience. i have been studying the health effects of long working hours for nearly 30 years. all the studies point to the potential dangers that can occur as the result of the additional risks created when work demands exceed a particular threshold. most of the studies i have performed suggest that the dangers are most pronounced when people regularly work more than 12 hours per day or 60 hours per week.

it sounded like a good idea

the idea of a four-day workweek is not new. labor experts have been studying and advocating these approaches since the 1970s. for example, in 2008, researchers from brigham young university conducted a series of surveys among employees and community members to assess their perspectives about a four-day workweek. the researchers found that about four-fifths of the employees reported a positive experience working that type of schedule.

based on these positive results, utah's governor enacted a mandatory four-day workweek for all state employees. the state's goal was to curb energy costs, improve air quality, ensure that needed services would still be available (for instance, garbage collection) and help to recruit and retain state employees. in 2011, however, utah reversed course, saying that savings never materialized.

other research has also supported the development and adoption of compressed work schedules. a 1989 study found that compressed schedules (pdf) were related to high levels of job satisfaction and employees' satisfaction with their work schedules; supervisors also reported they were pleased with the four-day workweek schedules.

are there hidden dangers?

despite the widespread enthusiasm for a four-day week, i am not convinced that kind of schedule is beneficial for employees or for businesses. the primary problem with the idea is that whatever work needs to be done, needs to get done in the same amount of total time. despite wishes to the contrary, there are still only 24 hours in a day.

the math is simple: working five eight-hour shifts is equivalent to working four 10-hour shifts. that's true. but the implications of these schedules are different. the danger is in disregarding the health effects that can occur as a result of fatigue and stress that accumulate over a longer-than-normal working day.

i performed a study showing that the risk of suffering an industrial accident is raised by 37 percent for employees working more than 12 hours in a day. the risk is 61 percent higher for people in ""overtime"" shifts. working more than 60 hours in a week is related to an additional injury risk of 23 percent. as the hours worked in those schedules increase, the risks grow accordingly.

more recently, dr. xiaoxi yao, a colleague of mine who is now at the mayo clinic, and i recently performed another study using 32 years of work-hour information to analyze the relationship between long working hours over many years and the risk of being diagnosed with a chronic disease later in life. we found that the dangers were quite substantial , especially for women.

women working more than 60 hours per week, equivalent to 12 hours per day, were more than three times as likely to eventually suffer heart disease, cancer, arthritis or diabetes, and more than twice as likely to have chronic lung disease or asthma, as women working a conventional 40-hour workweek. working just a bit more, an average of 41 to 50 hours per week, over many years appeared to substantially increase the long-term risk of disease.

these studies show that not all hours are created equal. the research suggests that harm may occur past a certain point . a four-day week causes workers to squeeze more hours than usual into a day. for workers who are already prone to overwork, the additional burden of compressing five days into four could literally break the camel's -- or worker's -- back.

is the stress worth it?

besides the health issues, employers and workers also need to consider the effect that compressing hours into a four-day period has on workers' mental health, stress levels and fatigue.

occupational psychologists realize that people do not function as effectively when tired or stressed. this may be even more of a concern for older persons.

moreover, just squeezing five days of 10-hour-a-day work into a compressed 40-hour schedule can create more rigidity and reduced flexibility for families and children. for example, if the two additional work hours per day are added onto a conventional day schedule that begins in the morning at approximately 8 or 9 a.m. and extends into the late afternoon hours at about 4 to 5 p.m., then many working parents will lose the ability to interact with their children just at the ""prime time"" of about 5 to 7 p.m. when kids otherwise would be most likely to be in the house and potentially available to socialize with their siblings and parents -- before their bedtime arrives.

there are many obvious ways to address these concerns and make life easier for workers and their families. don't overwork. don't stay too long at work. find a job with an employer that has flexible working hours.

i don't know about you, but the prospect of a four-day week scares me. i already have a hard enough time getting my regular weekly work done over five days. and it's always so tempting to glance at my work email -- just a couple more notes to jot down.

instead, why not just pull back at a certain point? maybe it's time to take friday off every so often. how about ending work at noon on fridays, as is the practice of many jews, to bring in the weekend in a gradual way? the trade-off, if necessary, would involve adding a small increase of one hour per day to the normal monday through friday schedule. that approach is actually my personal favorite.

my friend lonnie golden, a professor at pennsylvania state university - abington, advocates adopting a ""goldilocks"" workweek: one that is not too long, not too short and that satisfies the employer's interest in productivity and the employee's interest in attaining good health and well-being.

the surgery was led by dr. james goodrich, considered the leading expert on what's known as craniopagus surgery.

it marked the seventh and longest separation surgery performed by goodrich -- and just the 59th craniopagus separation surgery in the world since 1952.

nicole and christian had to make an excruciating decision, opting for the procedure even though it carried major risks, including the possibility of death or long-term brain damage for one or both boys. but not to operate also carried risks: 80% of twins joined at the head die of medical complications by age 2 if not separated, studies show.

goodrich informed the family of the separation around 3 a.m.

""well, we did it,"" goodrich said.

on her facebook page , nicole wrote: ""two separate babies!!!...and yet i ache with the uncertainty of the future. i didn't cry until the surgeons left the room. i was barely able to even utter the words 'thank you' because of the pit that still sits heavy in my stomach. we are standing on the brink of a vast unknown. the next few months will be critical in terms of recovery and we will not know for sure how anias and jadon are recovering for many weeks.""

the moment capped an end to an agonizing wait for the boys' parents.

the mcdonalds and montefiore hospital invited cnn to document this remarkable and rare journey of jadon and anias, allowing cnn exclusive access into the operating room throughout the procedure.

yet before nicole and christian learned their boys were now two individuals, thursday was a day of high emotion and high stakes, of anxious parents and calm medical professionals. it was a day of uncharted territory and amazing, one-of-a-kind surgical activity.

and amid it all were two infants -- beautiful boys with deep brown eyes and a shared swirl of hair at the top of their foreheads. they came into the world together, and became two individual boys overnight.

the parents' worries extend beyond the surgery; they wonder what happens in recovery.

'i feel good'

dr. goodrich stands in operating room number 10. it's a drab off-white, and empty of people. two operating tables sit in the middle of the room, abutted together. a 3d replica of the boys' heads sits between them.

it's 6:52 a.m.

the doctor began his day by skipping breakfast and enjoying a single cappuccino.

it's been 12 years since he last separated twins conjoined at the head at montefiore. that was his first ever craniopagus surgery, and he's learned much since then, performing five other separation surgeries around the world, including syrian twins in saudi arabia earlier this year.

prior to the mid-1980s, it was accepted medical practice to sacrifice one child on the operating table to save the life of the other. many times both babies died. if one child made it through surgery, he or she often suffered debilitating brain damage.

dr. james t. goodrich in his office at the children's hospital at montefiore.

goodrich has pioneered the field. he established the practice of performing the separation of craniopagus twins in several shorter stages, instead of one single operation lasting more than 50 hours. the mcdonalds have had three previous operations, each resulting in progressively more separated brains. today is the fourth and final stage. none of goodrich's conjoined twins have died during the operation. his mantra: ""take it easy and slowly and carefully.""

his surgical cap embodies that philosophy: it's decorated with turtles.

""don't change what works,"" he says. ""ready to go.""

within minutes, he and dr. oren tepper -- the plastic surgeon charged with reconstructing the boys' skulls and stitching their heads back together -- go to the 10th floor to a corner room where jadon and anias are resting with their family.

the doctors exchange pleasantries with mom, dad and other family members who crowd the room. asked how he's feeling, goodrich breaks out into a james brown-like jig. ""i feel good,"" he croons.

at 7:12 a.m., the boys are wheeled out of the room. their older brother, aza, lies with the twins on the stretcher as they're taken down an elevator and through a phalanx of hallways toward the third floor operating room.

""open door,"" aza says.

it's time to say goodbye. against his will, aza is taken off the stretcher. ""babies, babies,"" he says, reaching toward his brothers.

mom and dad kiss their boys bye. ""we'll see our two boys later,"" christian tells nicole.

nicole scoops up aza and cradles him. the three walk away. the twins go straight into the or.

it's 7:18 a.m.

'failure is not an option'

in a waiting area off the operating room, goodrich and tepper huddle with neuroradiologist joaquim farinhas.

farinhas shows off a three-dimensional replica of the boys' brain vessels that can be pulled apart, revealing exactly how they are fused together. the boys share about an inch-and-a-half diameter of brain tissue.

""this is what i wanted you to see,"" farinhas says, ""which is something that is soft and you can actually poke in and cut through.""

goodrich studies it for a bit before saying, ""ready to rock 'n' roll.""

""absolutely,"" farinhas says.

""failure is not an option,"" goodrich replies. it's 7:22 a.m.

for the next two hours, the boys are prepped for surgery. the place is a hub of activity, but of steely calm. the boys drift to sleep under anesthesia.

at 9:27 a.m., plastic sheets are placed over their naked bodies, followed by blue surgical drapes. moments later, their heads are wiped clean and tepper takes a black marker and outlines incisions from the three previous surgeries.

at 9:36 a.m., neurosurgery nurses bindu peter and treshia alex conduct what is known as a ""timeout"" -- a required protocol before surgeries. they name both patients on the tables and the operations taking place this day, october 13, 2016.

""we are doing craniopagus separation, fasciocutaneous scalp flaps, removal of expander, cranioplasty with bone graft, possible skin graft or use skin substitute, adjacent tissue transfer scalp, possible insertion of tissue expanders, possible insertion of wound closure device,"" peter says.

""correct.""

more than 20 people in the room -- surgeons, doctors, nurses, staff -- say their names and titles.

""how long will the case take?"" says peter.

goodrich: ""long.""

""any patient-specific concerns?"" the nurse asks.

""bleeding,"" one voice says.

""we have cross-matched two units of blood. it is in the blood bank,"" peter responds.

""correct,"" goodrich.

there's some small talk, then goodrich motions with his hands to peter, as if to say you're forgetting something. ""final line?"" he says.

""may the surgeon do a wonderful job,"" one doctor says.

others chime with ""a wonderful job!"" and ""good luck!""

goodrich flashes a thumbs up: ""thank you.""

it's time to operate. tepper makes the first incision at 9:45 a.m.

dr. james t. goodrich holds a 3d model of the mcdonald's twins in his office at montefiore.

'the easiest part is done'

the next several hours are a whir of activity. in the three previous surgeries, the surgical team added tissue expanders to stretch the skin to make sure there was enough to cover their new skulls. surgeons also separated some of the veins to make way for today's final separation.

mom and dad eat breakfast with their extended family and take aza to a nearby park. nicole is relieved to have aza to look after because chasing after him keeps her anxiety in check.

christian goes to a dollar store and buys packs of thank you cards. he and nicole spend more than an hour writing personal notes to their closest friends and family for helping them get this far.

the family holes up in the caregiver support center, two floors and two corridors away from the operating room. shortly after cnn's first story about the family appears thursday morning, nicole and christian start getting swamped with messages from friends and strangers alike. they monitor the hashtag #jadonandanias and watch as thousands of dollars in donations pour into their gofundme page.

they're buoyed by the messages of support from people as far away as the philippines and germany. they say their faith is renewed in mankind -- that it's a nice break from sordid headlines and the hotly contested political season.

humanity wins.

""everybody is really showing how much they love these boys,"" christian says. ""i didn't realize how many people out there have so much good in them and how much they want to help.""

nicole had quit her job as a pediatric physical therapist to care for the twins. she reads notes from mothers whose children she once cared for, including one who nicknamed her ""miracle worker."" on her facebook page, that mother writes, ""nicole is a miracle worker and now we're seeing miracles worked in her life.""

""they're all just so heartfelt,"" nicole says.

by noon, the surgical team has taken out one tissue expander and removed some temporary plates that were inserted in the earlier surgeries to hold bone back.

at 12:04 p.m., it's time to turn the boys to get to a new area to cut -- a delicate maneuver that requires all hands on deck.

""1, 2, 3, lift!"" a team member says.

jadon's shoulders rotate 45 degrees. they adjust anias into a similar position. tepper remains calm, continuing his work.

goodrich stands and turns away from the table. he grabs a nearby 3d replica of the boys' conjoined skulls. a wine connoisseur, he studies it, mulls it over like a fine chardonnay. he's facing two large screen televisions. one shows a live view of the surgery going on behind him. the other provides images of three-dimensional computer models of the boys' veins, arteries and other brain matter.

soon, goodrich returns to the table. working diligently with him is tepper and three other surgeons: dr. rani nasser and dr. ajit jada, both chief residents of neurosurgery, and dr. carrie stern, senior resident of plastic surgery.

the high-pitched sounds of tiny cutting instruments pierce the air. a smell, not unlike that of having a cavity filled at the dentist's office, permeates all around.

at 1:55 p.m, more than four hours into the surgery, goodrich turns around and says, ""the easiest part is done.""

fifteen minutes later, a chunk of skull is removed. no time to rest. the surgical team presses on. they take out a second tissue expander shortly before 3 p.m.

soon after, goodrich sneaks off for two slices of pizza in a quiet, secluded room in the hospital. nineteen minutes later, he heads back to the operating room.

'land of the unknown'

nicole and christian bide their time with family. aza bounces off the walls. grandparents and others pitch in to keep the 3-year-old from driving their mom and dad too crazy.

mom enjoys the distraction. they get occasional updates on the surgery from a nurse practitioner for pediatric neurosurgery. christian wishes they'd get more news on how it's going.

the family members wear white t-shirts nicole designed. the front of the shirt says anias with its hebrew meaning, ""god has answered,"" and jadon, ""god has heard."" an infinity sign -- often used as a symbol for conjoined twins -- goes across the middle.

nicole made the shirts to try to raise a few bucks. soon, she had 200 orders. the family ended up selling 1,000.

""i'm gonna hug my wife,"" christian says, pulling her tight and holding her.

the time now is 4:46 p.m.

the day has been a whirlwind since saying goodbye to the boys nine hours earlier.

nicole had never even posted a photograph depicting the boys as conjoined until a month ago.

she always took tight shots of each boy's face to show them as individuals. but she knew she wanted to speak to cnn and needed to be brave to ""better prepare myself for exposing my children to the world.""

so, she posted one photo of the boys conjoined on facebook and then another on her gofundme page. ""i said, 'ok, i'm getting real brave.'""

""the response was beautiful,"" she says.

and now, this day, her boys' day of separation -- a symbolic ""second birthday"" -- the outpouring of love has been awesome.

""the babies steal the show,"" christian says.

nicole: ""it's their eyes.""

""we would have it no other way, though,"" christian responds.

it's now past 5 p.m. as the day progresses, they know their anxiety will intensify. their boys have gone through the three prior surgeries, and they know the doctors are still making their way through basically undoing those three surgeries before going into the final separation phase.

""i call it the land of the unknown,"" nicole says.

yet their worries extend beyond their boys surviving today. they wonder what happens with recovery. will they have seizures? will they suffer heart failure? how long will they be in intensive care?

despite their worries, nicole says, ""when we sent them off this morning, to me, i felt at peace with it and just ready to handle what comes after.""

dr. goodrich and nicole mcdonald with the twins before surgery.

the most critical phase

shortly before 9 p.m., the operating room intensifies. the surgeons have reached their most critical phase: they must separate the shared blood vessels between the two boys. veins are very thin walled, and one section of jadon and anias' brains are intricately tied together, much more so than originally believed.

a single cut that goes too deep can lead to catastrophic bleeding.

neuroradiologist joaquim farinhas stands in front of the screen displaying the 3d computer model. he calls dr. ajit jada over from the operating table and points at the cluster of veins. farinhas dispenses advice. jada returns to the table.

""be very gentle with anias' side,"" farinhas calls out to the surgical team.

tepper, who had taken a brief break, returns to the table.

""it's a bear,"" says farinhas.

""this is the most important part,"" he explains, ""because the vessels are so delicate and they're so complicated. it's almost a lake of veins that they're trying to negotiate. it's pretty amazing.""

the surgical team has to figure out: how do you tie it off safely? how do you separate it? should we proceed?

at 9:18 p.m., goodrich says, ""we just closed off the sagittal sinus.""

""that chardonnay is on the way,"" quips farinhas.

a note of levity amid the intensity.

the last stitch

seconds tick off into minutes, which turn into hours.

the surgery is meticulous, tricky, complex. and that's an understatement.

at 1:18 a.m., tepper, the plastic surgeon, steps to a nearby metallic table and takes a special saw to split a removed skull piece into two. those two pieces will be used for the boys' new skullcaps.

goodrich and his team continue to work away toward the moment of separation. at about 1:40 a.m., he sits in a seat next to the operating table with hands crossed, as if admiring the work. moments later, he stands and dives right back into surgery.

at 2:10 a.m., goodrich says, ""one more inch.""

""we're ready. you ready?"" one surgeon says.

""yep,"" goodrich says.

it's a badge of honor as to who gets the last cut when separating conjoined twins.

""the last stitch,"" tepper says. ""who wants it?""

the only woman surgeon at the table, dr. carrie stern, makes the historic last cut, at 2:11 a.m.

""we are official,"" goodrich says.

the room bursts into spontaneous applause.

THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Chicago","like a super-sensitive human nose, an experimental technology can ""smell"" and identify the chemical composition of a person's breath and then diagnose up to 17 potential diseases, according to the scientists who developed it.

these researchers, led by hossam haick of the technion-israel institute of technology, say their na-nose, which uses nanorays to analyze breath, can identify parkinson's disease, various cancers, kidney failure, multiple sclerosis and crohn's disease with 86% accuracy.

""i would say our technology in many cases (is) equivalent to the accuracy of the currently available invasive technology,"" haick said, adding that for some diseases, including gastric cancer, na-nose has a ""much higher"" accuracy rate than currently available technologies. and, unlike most screenings, including standard blood tests, breath analysis technology is noninvasive -- a benefit most patients would appreciate.

the theory behind the technology is that each of us has a unique chemical ""fingerprint."" each disease also has a particular chemical signature, which can be detected on our breath. the na-nose technology, which consists of a sensor chamber with a breathing tube and software, is able to detect this precise chemistry of disease by interpreting the impact on our usual chemical fingerprint.

seven companies have licensed the underlying research for the technology from technion in hopes of creating a commercial product, haick said. he hopes that the companies, each specializing in a different application, will translate the science and technology from the lab to mass production.

one application, for example, would turn smartphones into ""sniffphones"" that would monitor our health routinely.

but with further testing and regulations to meet, neither the na-nose device nor any variations will be available on the market -- or in our doctor's offices -- for a number of years, said haick.

dogs, flies and rats

though na-nose may seem revolutionary, smell was recognized as a potential diagnostic tool in antiquity.

""the ancient greeks used breath and urine scent to diagnose disease,"" said dr. mangilal agarwal, director of the integrated nanosystems development institute and an associate professor at richard l. roudebush va medical center in indianapolis. ""thucydides said there was a specific scent to plague victims in athens, and hippocrates cataloged a specific disease because it caused bad breath and bad-smelling sweat.""

agarwal, who is not involved with the na-nose technology, said he is working on a number of projects that analyze scents to diagnose diseases, including hypoglycemia (low blood sugar ), prostate cancer and breast cancer.

""breath has the scents or volatile biomarkers necessary to identify many diseases,"" he said. ""we know this from canines who can detect hypoglycemia and epileptic seizures, fruit flies (and canines) that can detect cancer , and from giant rats that detect tuberculosis in africa .""

""dr. haick's group is certainly ahead of our group in terms of getting close to doctor's visit tests,"" agarwal said, adding that an important aspect to breath analysis is that it ""excels at capturing changes in human health in a noninvasive manner.""

""quick diagnosis can help in identifying the most appropriate treatment response,"" he said. he added that prostate cancer grows on a longer time-scale, but the prostate biopsy is such ""a sufficiently unpleasant experience"" that a noninvasive test would be beneficial and lower health-care costs.

the high accuracy claims of haick's research group is ""very reasonable, if the signal is not masked by environmental fluctuations in some manner,"" agarwal said, though he cautions that some ""breath-based tests have had difficulty duplicating results in different regions, likely because the sensor has difficulty adjusting to different background air signals.""

other scientists raise additional concerns.

not ready for prime time?

dr. george preti, a faculty researcher at monell chemical senses center, a nonprofit scientific institute in philadelphia, said it's hard to distinguish body chemicals from environmental chemicals in breath samples because ""most of the compounds detected in breath are also detected in room air and their levels are similar to each other.""

until scientists ""understand the origin and biochemical pathways leading to disease-related"" markers in human breath, reliable results from a diagnostic breath test will be difficult to achieve, he stated in a recent review of studies

in fact, there are more than a few issues that must be addressed before effective technologies will be produced, according to dr. lisa spacek, an adjunct assistant professor at johns hopkins school of medicine, and terence risby, professor emeritus at the johns hopkins university bloomberg school of public health.

using breath to diagnose disease first requires a profile of breath molecules for normal health to be established, spacek and risby say in a recently published paper . these must take into account variables such as age, gender, ethnicity and body mass index.

researchers also need to investigate the factors that might contaminate breath results, such as what someone ate within eight hours of breath collection or whether they used a mouth rinse, say spacek and risby. another issue: how do you store breath that is not immediately analyzed?

advances in instrumentation, particularly portable monitors, is one factor inspiring and enabling the new research into breath analysis.

though the field is growing and results are promising, translation of the work into meaningful tests is another matter: ""i take every claim by manufacturers ... with a grain of salt,"" risby wrote in an email.

follow cnn health on facebook and twitter see the latest news and share your comments with cnn health on facebook and twitter.

today's widespread interest in breath analysis stems from the relatively recent discovery -- within the past 20 years or so -- that nitric oxide, a common pollutant, works as a signaling molecule in the cardiovascular system, risby observes. the three scientists who made the discovery won a nobel prize for their efforts in 1998.

""i still remember watching our current head coach [inoue] win the olympic gold,"" he recalls. ""it was at this moment that i thought that i wanted to be no. 1 in the world.""

inoue would end his career as a three-time world champion while hashimoto currently has just one world crown to his name, picked up at the recent championships in budapest where japan topped the medal table with eight golds and 14 medals in all.

""i was so happy to take home the world title,"" he says of his win over rustam orujov for the gold. ""i suffered many injuries but i believe it didn't affect me on the day of the fights.""

he employed what he calls ""the hashimoto special"" but it is better known in judo parlance as sode tsurikomi goshi, effectively a hip throw in which he grips an opponents' sleeves and then turns to face the same direction as them.

(cnn) over the summer and into fall, the standoff with north korea had settled into a familiar if dangerous pattern. us officials issued vague warnings that they could take the peninsula to war, while north korea steadily advanced its nuclear and missile programs.

throughout, the military situation has remained remarkably stable: neither side has fired on the other or mobilized its forces for a full scale war, and to this date, provocations have been confined to tests and talk.

it is not pyongyang, but washington, that appears determined to push this standoff into the military domain.

preparing for war?

this month, us forces in and around korea made several provocative moves apparently designed to provoke pyongyang and the north korean regime's allies in beijing.

us and south korean forces are holding live-fire naval exercises in the waters around the peninsula, involving the uss ronald reagan carrier strike group, nominally to practice against special operations forces.

furthermore, two submarines have visited the korean peninsula, including the uss michigan, a guided missile submarine. us forces will also practice evacuating american noncombatants from south korea. though this training occurs regularly, it could be misinterpreted when it occurs in parallel with other forceful signals.furthermore, two submarines have visited the korean peninsula, including the uss michigan, a guided missile submarine.

in the skies around the peninsula, b1-b bomber flights are becoming more complex and more assertive. one month ago, at least one b1-b and an escort of f-35 fighters flew over international waters north of the demilitarized zone between north and south korea. last week, us b1-bs performed a missile-firing drill in the seas between korea and japan, crossed the peninsula and did another drill in the yellow sea near china. jassm missiles carried by the b1-b could reach into chinese territory from those launch points.

last week, the b1-bs were back in south korea for an airshow, along with f-22 and f-35 advanced stealth fighters and other military aircraft. on monday, the us air force announced that 12 f-35as will deploy next month to japan.

in short, in the last month, the us has rehearsed all the actions it would need to take to start a war.

military provocations

announcements of these actions come with vague and repeated statements from the white house that it is actively considering military options and ""time is running out"" for alternatives. the administration is apparently trying to paint missions intended to assure us allies as military preparations in order to aggravate pyongyang and beijing.

these provocations seem based on an idea that raising the risk of war can force china or north korea to capitulate to washington's demands, ignoring recent history.

the last 10 months of vague threats and sporadic military provocations prove kim jong un cannot be frightened into surrendering his nuclear arsenal: in early july, a month after two us aircraft carriers staged drills off south korea, the north tested its first icbm. in fact, last month kim said personally he considers trump's vague threats a sign of weakness and proof that north korea must stay its course.

china is also unlikely to bow to military pressure. beijing's overwhelming concern of the last few months has been to keep the us and north korea quiet ahead of the communist party's national congress, a highly choreographed event during which president xi jinping will consolidate his power

in the past, north korea has staged missile and other tests during high-profile chinese meetings , but xi will have warned kim in no uncertain terms this is not the week to act out.

in his tweets and statements, trump has repeatedly attempted to exploit china-north korea tensions, with little of consequence to show for it. are us military moves this month designed to provoke a north korean test during the chinese party congress? are american exercises in the yellow sea meant to alarm beijing? it's not clear.

time for deterrence

each of the recent us military deployments is temporary: at the end of the event or exercise, the ships and aircraft will rotate onto other missions. despite major advancements in north korean nuclear and missile programs and concerns from us allies about washington's willingness to defend them, the administration has not authorized new military deployments to south korea.

in this, the current us military posture may be the worst of both worlds: it raises the possibility of an altercation with north korea without providing the extra forces to deter and defend against one. in this climate, there is a very real risk that any military move could lead to an accidental war if north korea's leaders miscalculate or feel pressured to demonstrate defiance in the face of us threats.

the us and its allies have no interest in provoking north korea. the trump administration should set aside the false hope there is a military solution to the problem with pyongyang and abandon its careless threats to attack north korea.

both washington and seoul should stop threatening kim jong un with ""decapitation""; if kim rightly or wrongly believes an assassination attempt is on the way, this will raise the risk of a preemptive nuclear strike.

finally, temporary military displays send precisely the wrong signal to pyongyang: they raise the risk of an unwanted war and raise questions about whether the us is really committed to deterring north korea in the long run.

if the trump administration can cease its careless threats, the us and its allies could begin a real conversation about whether new deployments of unambiguously defensive military forces are needed to deter north korea. pyongyang cannot be allowed to think its new nuclear missiles will allow it to attack with submarines or special operations forces. the allies need new capabilities to deter this kind of aggression, but it will require a sustained effort, not a week-long visit from an aircraft carrier.

holding to a defensive military posture would also afford us military commanders and diplomats new deterrent and diplomatic options for preventing north korea from launching missiles toward guam or conducting an atmospheric nuclear test -- practical but vital objectives for the coming months.

the security of the us homeland and our allies requires that we maintain stability on the korean peninsula, not undermine it. it is time to abandon wishful thinking and get serious about deterring a nuclear north korea. THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Indianapolis","deter, don't provoke, north korea"

for many girls, girl scouts will remain the preferable option. THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Austin","mike surbaugh is the chief scout executive of boy scouts of america. the views expressed in this commentary are his own.

(cnn) consider for a moment the benefits of camaraderie, confidence, resilience, trustworthiness, courage and kindness. if we hope to see these attributes in our children and in the future generation of leaders, it is important that we strengthen efforts to instill those values. i will celebrate every institution that seeks to do so -- and that includes the girl scouts.

since its inception in 1912, the girl scouts' renowned program has helped empower generations of courageous and confident young women who seek to make the world a better place. it is a strong program that works. i believe in the girl scouts just as i believe in boy scouts and all character-building efforts. nonetheless, we decided it was time to open our doors, and welcome girls into cub scouting. this decision does not make our programs co-ed; it provides single-sex programs for girls, in addition to the current programs for boys.

still, this decision has, not surprisingly, stirred up a fair amount of controversy. my hope is that the conversations taking place will bring more attention to the powerful work all youth-serving organizations do -- but i also want to explain as clearly as i can how and why we made this decision.

first thing's first: we did it because our members requested it. for years, they've been asking us to bring our unique approach to character and leadership development to all members of their families. after all, the cornerstone qualities of the boy scouts are invaluable to all, regardless of gender. so we decided it was time to make our iconic programs available for boys and girls.

but the policy change isn't as dramatic as many people seem to think. we've had girls participating in scouting for generations. it started in 1971, when we invited girls to join our exploring program and strengthened in 1998 when we introduced venturing as an adventure program for boys and girls. for years, too, we've been hearing about sisters unofficially participating in cub scouting by ""shadowing"" their brothers. so officially or unofficially, we've been including girls for a long time. and that led us to formally evaluate the matter this year to determine how best to serve today's families.

in the spring, we began formally discussing our program offerings. we started by sharing our idea of expanding our programs to girls with professional staff. overwhelmingly, they felt it was time to open up the discussion of formalizing enrollment for girls in our programs to our volunteers.

that led us to gauge interest from about 1,000 top volunteer leaders from nearly every council in america. we asked them to vote on whether they'd like to open the discussion to the rest of the volunteers in our organization. ninety-three percent approved.

during the summer, our local councils began hosting town hall meetings with families across the country. we asked them for their input, and we got more than 11,000 responses. just like those original 1,000 volunteers, the vast majority said they were in favor of inviting girls and young women to join.

knowing that so much of our existing membership supported the idea wasn't enough, though. through market research, we learned that about 90% of families not currently involved in scouting are highly interested in a program designed like the one we plan to offer. many of these families echoed a common theme: they are busier than ever, and they need activities they can do as a family.

but in addition to all of this, we wanted to know whether our curriculum and program content is relevant for young women. to that end, we asked a panel of educators to make an assessment. they determined it was 100% applicable to girls.

based on all of these factors, our board voted unanimously that the time to act was now.

we acknowledge and celebrate that boys and girls develop differently, and there are times that single-gender learning is most appropriate. that is why we have outlined a structure that enables us to continue providing single-gender environments -- like dens within cub scout packs and a single-gender scouting program for older girls -- within a broader structure that will allow us to serve the whole family. it will be up to local cub scout packs, parents and chartered partners to choose whether to include boys and girls in family packs or only serve boys or girls; we anticipate a similar structure at the boy scouts level.

let me also be clear about this once more: we know there are many other fantastic youth organizations -- 4h, the ymca, the boys and girls club, girl scouts and more -- that provide character development opportunities for american children. parents deserve the ability to choose which option is best for their children. for many girls, girl scouts will remain the preferable option. we celebrate and support that decision. why? because it is a strong, time-tested program that builds character.

yet it's also true that most families in this country are not currently engaged with any character-building youth development program. there are over 70 million children in america that could benefit from our programs, and today, organizations like ours and others only serve a fraction of them. that is a huge unmet need, but one we can help address. our country needs and deserves more young people focused on the values that serve as the bedrock of our movement: duty to god and country, with a desire to help other people at all times.

for skeptics that ask if our decision was made to boost membership, consider what membership means. it means that more children can benefit from the scouting program, which has been proven to build character and leadership. it means that more young people will learn life skills that will empower them to take on challenges with greater resilience. i fervently believe in the strength of our programs, and their ability to change lives. if this decision allows us to bring the transformational power of our programs to more young people, then, yes, that is our motivation.

we are exhilarated at the possibilities this decision offers, not simply for the boy scouts of america, but for the future of our youth members and future generations of leaders. THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Austin","why the boy scouts are for girls now, too"

girls who went through such programs were more likely to become pregnant or have an abortion, according to a study published in the journal lancet

researchers tracked girls in 57 schools in western australia, from ages 13 to 15 until 20, through hospital medical and abortion clinic records. among the 2,800 girls who participated in the study from 2003 to 2006, 1,200 were randomly assigned to participate in baby simulator programs, while the rest underwent the standard pregnancy prevention curriculum.

the simulator program, called virtual infant parenting , is an adaptation of the american baby think it over program, created by realityworks. the vip program consists of workbooks, documentary viewing, four educational sessions and caring for interactive baby dolls over the weekend, from friday afternoon to monday morning.

the fake baby cries when it needs be fed, burped, rocked or changed and tracks mishandling and how well the doll is cared for. at the time of the study, each doll cost about $1,200 australian, equivalent to about $900 us.

the study found that 8% of girls who cared for the model babies had given birth at least once by age 20, compared with only 4% of those who took the standard classes. similarly, 9% of girls in the baby simulator group had at least one abortion, compared with 6% of the non-baby group.

this is the first long-term study to look at pregnancy outcomes of the program throughout girls' entire teenage years until they turn 20, said epidemiologist sally brinkman of the telethon kids institute at the university of western australia and lead author of the study.

'clearly, the program doesn't work'

the researchers took into account the girls' socioeconomic status, family type, prior sexual experience, prior baby-caring responsibility, level of psychological distress, smoking and alcohol use, and education, but the difference between the two groups remains significant.

""it is definitely more than just a trend,"" brinkman said. ""clearly, the program doesn't work.""

according to the study, schools in over 89 countries use the realityworks baby simulator program, including the united states.

the president and ceo of realityworks, timm boettcher, said the study recklessly associated its products with the australian health agencies' adapted versions.

the study ""was not a representation of our curriculum and simulator learning modality, but the researchers' 'adaptation' and is consequently not reflective of our product nor its efficacy,"" boettcher said in a statement. ""the realcare program, is a combination of curriculum and hands-on aids, and if they are being tested and judged for effectiveness should be judged in their entirety.""

brinkman said that although her study didn't involve as many educational sessions as realityworks' programs, what the researchers did for the study is overall ""very similar"" to what realityworks recommends. ""i would be surprised to see a couple of more educational sessions would make a difference on the results,"" she said.

she and her colleagues have advocated for an end to the fake baby program, but some schools asked whether the program should be tweaked or the girls should have the fake babies for longer.

brinkman is not sure whether such amendments would have an impact and compared the scenario to testing a drug. if research evidence has clearly pointed out adverse effects, ""it's generally not a thing for people to say 'oh, they just need more of the drug.' ""

brinkman considers this a cautionary tale and hopes long-term studies can be conducted in the future to evaluate the effectiveness of educational programs before they are widely implemented and cost taxpayers' money.

'maybe it wasn't that bad'

due to the anonymous nature of the study, researchers were unable to pinpoint reasons why the program might not work as well as planned.

brinkman suspects that a positive experience with taking care of a baby and getting attention from family and friends could be part of the reason. ""it gives them confidence. ... they think, 'maybe it wasn't that bad. i could do this,' "" she said.

dr. julie quinlivan , one of the study's reviewers and a professor at the university of notre dame australia, echoed brinkman's thoughts in a comment in the lancet (pdf). leaving the father out of the pregnancy equation and the program not starting early enough are also possible contributing factors, she wrote.

the root causes of teenage pregnancy, quinlivan noted in an email to cnn, include social, psychological and educational disadvantages. since these factors are similar in developed countries like the united states, the united kingdom and australia, the study's results are applicable in these countries, she said.

""when i saw this kind of fighting for the first time, i was quite shocked. i had never seen something like that before, and it was really interesting to experience all of this so close,"" said mazur, who photographed the fight club as part of her work toward graduation from photography school. ""inhibition and fear do not exist on the mat.""

in the 1980s and early 1990s, garish swirling graphics and colorful geometric shapes ruled american tv screens, department stores and high school playgrounds.

from fisher price toys to the opening credits of ""saved by the bell,"" the era's designers carved out a distinct day-glo look that is an unmistakable product of its time.

but they were all taking cues from one radical italian designer and architect: ettore sottsass.

sottsass' short-lived collective, memphis, was made up of about two dozen italian creatives. as well as attracting the attention of high-profile collectors, including karl lagerfeld and david bowie, the group's wildly stacked blocks and zig-zag patterns inspired the mainstream designers who defined the aesthetic of an optimistic age.

a 'renaissance' figure

but while sottsass is best known for his work with memphis, he spent just six years of his seven-decade career in the collective. by the time he formed the group in 1981, the austrian-born italian (then aged 64) had already traveled europe with allen ginsberg, photographed picasso and hemingway, built a postmodern new york flagship store for the fashion brand fiorucci, and helped design some of silicon valley's earliest computers.

his influence touched the farthest reaches of the design world, inspiring generations of young designers from across many disciplines, according to hans ulrich obrist, artistic director of london's serpentine galleries, who describes sottsass as a ""renaissance figure.""

""he was not just an industrial designer or an architect. he worked in ceramics, paintings, jewelry and interior design, as well as photography and writing. he was also the editor and publisher of his own magazine,"" said obrist, a friend of sottsass' for more than 10 years before the designer's death in 2007.

""it's common for people who make a great contribution in one field to go into different fields. but it's very rare for people to make amazing contributions to entirely different fields. he was unique.""

to mark the 100th anniversary of sottsass' birth, le stanze del vetro museum in venice exhibited more than 200 of his glass works earlier this year. a major retrospective of sottsass' work -- from both before and after his time with memphis -- will be on show until october at the new york metropolitan museum of art's new design-focused sister venue, the met breuer

here, we hear about sottsass' work and legacy from some of the design industry figures who knew -- and were inspired by -- the italian designer and his collective.

karim rashid is one of the most prolific designers of his generation, responsible for well-known creations including the bobble water bottle and the garbo trash can.

i studied with ettore sottsass for three months in 1983 and i remember his words: ""find what you can contribute that no one else can in this world.""

he did really powerful, useful design work. but you can really see his soul within it. the whole premise of memphis was almost ikea-like: these things would be super cheap and built out of plastic laminate. they were made to reach a lot of people.

at the same time, it was so poetic, powerful and experiential. (his work) makes us look at the physical world in a different way. it teaches us that objects around us can still function perfectly, but they can imbue and provoke such positive energy and spirit. they can also be radical, in that all of a sudden you see a very banal thing in very different way.

hans ulrich obrist

known for publishing hours' worth of interviews with the world's leading artists, hans ulrich obrist is the artistic director of london's serpentine galleries.

(sottsass) was 63 when he founded his architecture practice, sottsass associati. so, in his sixties, seventies, eighties, he developed a whole life as an architect which could be (considered) a career in itself. he designed the interiors of milan's malpensa airport, private homes and the famed early esprit stores.

if somebody had just his architecture career, that person would be a very significant architect of their generation. but he is this renaissance figure (who practiced) industrial design, ceramics, glass and interior design, but also paintings, photography and writing.

it's almost like the super string theory in science, where the world has 11 dimensions -- he brought all the disciplines and all the fields together in one person. every generation will find a different sottsass to revisit.

jack mccollough and lazaro hernandez

designers jack mccollough and lazaro hernandez founded new york-based womenswear and accessories brand proenza schouler in 2002. their clothing has featured memphis-inspired shapes and graphics.

proenza schouler

we'd love to say that we first discovered the memphis movement through the context of design history, but we, like many of our friends, really first encountered that particular aesthetic through things like ""saved by the bell,"" ""pee-wee's playhouse,"" and (skateboard brands) vision and santa cruz. it wasn't until much later on, during our college years, that we realized that this poppy, nostalgic aesthetic that so many of us responded to was actually rooted in a serious design movement.

it kind of authenticated our moments of being seduced by things like neon colors, graphic shapes and plastics. it's a look that harks back to a simpler, more wide-eyed and carefree moment in our lives. it takes us back to a time when many of us were first discovering popular culture via things like mtv. as a result, it has a special place in our hearts.

a stanford professor and founder of global design firm ideo, david kelley invented the world's first computer mouse. he lives in a house designed by ettore sottsass.

when was i was living in silicon valley in 1974 to 1975, i was inspired by ettore's designs on olivetti's computers and office (products). his stuff looked quite different from everything else -- it just made me think ""oh, you can think of these things differently."" sottsass only designed three houses in the united states, including the one in woodside, california, that i live in.

i put together a big book of all the things i'd wanted in the house, and what our lifestyle was like. he looked at the book for maybe 25 seconds and said: ""this looks like you want a house for living in the past. let's design you a house for living in the future."" as a worldly italian who enjoyed life, he was going to fix this nervous american's life by building him a house. i think he did build us a better life.

camille walala is a london-based print, graphic and textile designer whose bright, playful installations mix memphis influences and african design.

i grew up in the 80s, and my dad was an architect. he gave me some plates with these amazing triangle designs.

at the time, i didn't really know who the memphis movement or ettore sottsass were, but i loved them. we put (the plates) in boxes to keep them safe, and i completely forgot about them.

in 2008, i went to the university library and found some books about sottsass. i was hysterical looking at them. the colors and the sense of humor in his work -- i just didn't know there was already something like memphis in the design world. i love the architectural shape of the lamps, the toy-like hoovers and the carlton book shelf. for london design festival in 2015, i made (the installation) ""walala in da house"" with memphis patterns, plates, lamps and prints, which was a bit of an homage to them.

sottsass invented a very specific formula which (allowed him) to play with heavy, geometric shapes. and yet, his works were always full of sensuality and vibration. he said that, for him, there is no hierarchy in objects: to design an ashtray or a house is the same problem. it is as complicated to do an ashtray. it was very interesting to learn from sottsass that a good object is exactly like a beautiful person. it's a mix of different aspects that, in the end, chemically produce something bizarre and interesting. a good object is never a perfect answer.

i remember discovering (sottsass') work in college and being very influenced by its spirit. i think i was more inspired by his willingness to swim upstream against conventional taste than his visual language. i love the carlton bookshelf -- it's sort of anthropomorphic and feels like a dance party, which isn't often something you'd say about a bookshelf.

the shapes and colors of my lavumisa chandelier were really sottsass-inspired. (i designed it) at the height of a memphis revival, and i felt like i wanted to introduce some natural materials to the mix to see how it felt.

hidden in the back alleys of a bustling mumbai neighborhood lies an art deco masterpiece with a colorful history. the liberty cinema symbolizes a unique architectural amalgamation known as ""bombay deco."" dating back to the year of indian independence, 1947, the building also represents the rising aspirations of a nation.

""it's a statement to the indian people that no theater can be too good for them and no screen too good for indian pictures,"" reads a liberty brochure from 1949, a time when most elite cinemas in bombay only showed hollywood movies.

the 1,200-seat, single-screen movie theater was one of the last buildings to be constructed in the art deco architectural style. mumbai is widely believed to have the second largest collection of art deco buildings in the world

but the city's art deco heritage is under threat, according to atul kumar, founder of the not-for-profit conservation organization art deco mumbai. ""in the face of rising real estate prices, the art deco legacy of mumbai is at a real risk of being lost forever,"" he said in a phone interview.

a cosmopolitan collection

the origins of art deco in mumbai (which was officially known as bombay before 1995) can be traced back to the period between the two world wars.

during an era of relative prosperity and cosmopolitanism in india, a rising middle class found that it had the means to commission its own architecture.

taking influence from paris, miami, new york and los angeles, bombay deco put an indian twist on a well-known style. and it was all made possible by new construction materials, according to mustansir dalvi, professor of architecture at the sir jj school of art.

""you get an expression that is possible only with concrete,"" he said in a phone interview. ""wood horizontals, flat roofs, cantilevered balconies, smooth corners -- it is the materials that allows you to develop architecture that is quite unique.""

most bombay deco architects were indian, though they had often traveled to europe and america. while many of their buildings were created in a classic art deco style, some incorporated traditional indian motifs that made them distinct.

""the lakshmi insurance building is emblematic of indian-ness in art deco,"" dalvi said. ""it has a statue of (indian goddess) lakshmi on top, and elephants on the facade. you also see murals showing indian life, (while) depictions of labor can be seen in several places in mumbai.""

conservation efforts

in mumbai, conservation efforts often overlook bombay deco in favor of victorian-era buildings, which are usually larger and grander in stature.

""people are filled with regret when we tell them of the incredible histories behind these buildings,"" said kumar, whose organization offers architectural walking tours. ""they wish they'd known of the buildings' value earlier, so they could have better protected them.""

having been involved in conservation advocacy for over a decade, kumar contributed to a recently approved proposal to include bombay deco among india's nominations for unesco world heritage status. kumar has also launched an online inventory that he claims is the first attempt to comprehensively catalog the city's art deco buildings.

in one mumbai neighborhood, 53 examples were recorded in an area smaller than one square mile. and this is ""just the tip of the iceberg,"" kumar claimed.

""there are even areas outside the proposed world heritage site that have a large number of vintage art deco buildings,"" he added.

preserving the city's essence

many of mumbai's remaining art deco masterpieces have survived against the odds. having become obsolete in the multiplex era, the liberty cinema was at the brink of shutting before extensive renovations were carried out in 2012.

it is now a cultural space hosting a range of events, from theater performances to one of south asia's largest lgbt film festivals. but the future of the cinema remains uncertain, according its owner nazir hoosein.

""in the eyes of the government, we might as well be an auditorium with bare walls,"" he said in a phone interview. ""they don't see the magnificent heritage of this cinema.""

amid lax conservation laws and growing demand for land in india's most populous city, conserving mumbai's architectural heritage may seem like a futile enterprise. but for bombay deco enthusiasts like dalvi, it is the only way to preserve the city's essence.

""art deco is, in many ways, a depiction of cosmopolitan bombay,"" he said.

""these buildings collectively form the urban fabric of the city. transforming them into multi-story towers would be a destruction of that fabric -- and a destruction of that bombay."" THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for New York",mumbai's art deco buildings survive against the odds

former mlb pitcher roy halladay died tuesday in a plane crash in the a5, which was found upside down in shallow water off florida's gulf coast. halladay, 40, was the only person on the two-seater plane.

it was the second fatal crash involving the a5 this year.

in may, jon karkow , icon's chief test pilot who was responsible for the plane's design, died in a crash in california. cagri sever, a new employee who was in the passenger's seat, also was killed.

the national transportation safety board concluded that the probable cause of that accident was pilot error . the plane had been flying at lake berryessa, a reservoir with coves, canyons and steep rising terrain.

""it is likely that the pilot mistakenly thought the canyon that he entered was a different canyon that led to the larger, open portion of the lake,"" according to the ntsb's aviation accident report.

instead, there was no exit from that canyon. ""the airplane would have not been able to climb out of the rising terrain that surrounded the area, which led to his failure to maintain clearance from terrain,"" according to the ntsb report.

icon initially suspended all flight operations of the a5 fleet after the accident but resumed them after ntsb's preliminary report.

the ntsb will investigate the latest crash involving halladay.

the certification for the plane was issued monday, meaning the aircraft was brand new, according to the federal aviation administration's website.

there were no distress calls from the plane, the pasco county, florida, sheriff's office said.

icon aircraft expressed its condolences to halladay's family and friends.

""icon will do everything it can to support the accident investigation going forward and we will comment further when more information is available,"" a statement said.

icon a5s are considered light, amphibious airplanes. they can land on water or land, have folding wings and can be transported by trailers.

the controls of the icon a5 have been likened to that of a sports car. it has been described as so intuitive that the company said even a novice can learn to fly in less than 30 hours.

the first production units were delivered in july 2015.

in a video about the a5 that the company removed but was preserved elsewhere, halladay said he grew up around airplanes, because his dad was a pilot.

the former pitcher said he always wanted to get his pilot's license but wasn't able to do so while playing baseball. after retirement, halladay pursued his love of flight. THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Charlotte","icon a5, described as 'sports car with wings,' has 2nd fatal crash this year"

he said there was ""no downside"" in transitioning into a world which only uses renewable energy. THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Los Angeles","but there's a catch: how do you develop technology that can withstand the sea's harsh environment with minimum disruption to the ecosystem?

one israeli-based company, yam pro energy -- believes it can offer the ideal solution and is set to build a wave-energy plant on the coastline of accra, ghana's capital city.

wave technology is an endeavor that has recently been trying to catch up with the likes of solar and wind energy.

it exploits a resource -- the oceans -- that covers 71 per cent of our planet, it's environmentally friendly, mostly cost-free once set up and it could be revolutionary to coastal countries.

""there's so many wave power companies and as many different devices, so finding one that actually works best is trial and error,"" said mark jacobson, who is a stanford university professor and director at the solutions project , a company which aims to help the world move to 100% renewable energy.

however, yam pro energy says its innovative technology is the ""best choice in renewable energy systems.""

the machinery will utilize the crashing waves to harvest hydraulic pressure and turn it into electricity.

""it was easy,"" laughed yam pro energy's ceo, zeev peretz. ""we negotiated (with ghana) for many years, but in the end we succeeded.""

""the demand (for energy) is very big and i think it will help people (improve) their life.""

""floaters"" will be connected to wave breakers on the coastline and will bob up and down as waves crash in.

peretz said their technology was much more efficient than other renewable energy sources because it can generate 65% of energy per year, compared to solar panels and wind turbines which generate between 22-24%.

""the rest is heat and just waste,"" peretz said.

the technology will be built on ghana's coastline in accra.

the advantages of wave power, the company argues, is that their machines do not emit pollution, waves are more predictable than other renewable sources and despite the original set up being costly, the running and maintenance costs are low.

""if the waves are too high we are given forecasts days ahead which helps to analyze the situation,"" peretz said.

while construction in accra won't begin until well into 2017, yam pro energy has already secured the coastline to build its power station. it has also teamed up with local partners, secured its power purchase agreement (ppa) from the local electrical company and has been given space on the grid so it can sell the energy produced.

peretz said 10,000 households will benefit from the project.

no impact on wildlife?

according to emanuele taibi, an island energy analyst from the international renewable energy agency (irena), the biggest challenge with wave power is proving it can withstand the sea's harsh environments.

""there are quite a lot of prototypes and they're doing quite well, but (for an investor), the main point is over 20 years -- how will the machine perform?""

peretz said yam pro energy had taken this into consideration and that it will conduct maintenance frequently.

the ""floaters"" can be pulled up out of the water if maintenance needs to be done or if the conditions are too rough.

compared to other devices -- like buoys -- which can become destroyed and sink in rough seas, yam pro energy's patent is more efficient, it says.

""we don't have to send scuba divers or boats out. all the maintenance is from the land, so we just put floaters up and you (can) do whatever you need to do (then) put them back down.""

the company prides itself on providing renewable energy that's clean and affordable in an environmentally responsible way. but greenpeace's uk chief scientist and policy director, doug parr told cnn that while it supported wave power, checks needed to be in place to ensure the technology doesn't impact wildlife.

""no source of power has zero impact on the environment,"" he said, adding that assessments need to be made to ""judge whether the clean energy benefits are justified.""

future predictions

jacobson, from the solutions project, supported the development of wave technology in ghana, but said that its growth won't be as rapid as solar and wind. ""while there's a reasonable resource of wave power to exploit, if you're comparing it to other technologies it's just not going to be penetrating as much,"" he said.

instead, it will compliment other renewable energy technologies. ""it's definitely worthwhile doing ... we should invest (in it) as much as we can.""

the solutions project predicts that if ghana can transition to 100% clean, renewable energy by 2050, wave energy will account for 1.4 per cent of it.

and while that may seem small, jacobson insisted it wasn't. ""the amount of energy worldwide is enormous. so something that is large is actually small in comparison to the power demand worldwide.""

he said there was ""no downside"" in transitioning into a world which only uses renewable energy.

""these countries can become more energy independent. there's less risk of conflict, less terrorism because there's fewer centralized plants and you solve the climate problem simultaneously.""

irena's taibi was more optimistic. he said that while the growth of wave power has been gradual, it was only ""a matter of time"" before it became the ""sixth pillar"" of renewable energy that will become commercialized.

why? whether the pollsters bemoan it or celebrate it, the percentage of americans who are losing their religion is rising. and in a presidential election year, candidates need to take note.

two of those remaining, donald trump and hillary clinton, still give lip service to being religious -- even if many on either side of religion don't believe them or want to claim them. (why would this be the only thing either one of them would tell the truth about?)

the libertarian candidate, former new mexico gov. gary johnson, who has the most executive experience and the least amount of experience lying, seems to never mention god. he's the one who believes that separation of church and state gives the most freedom for theists and atheists.

this tracks with a growing reality about religion in america. and those of us who are atheists -- living godless since forever -- have been trying to get a hint as to why so many are suddenly seeing through the glass darkly.

some think the september 11 attacks caused a big spike in atheism, as many people hipped to the fact that a benevolent god wouldn't allow that to happen. i don't think that was it. i don't think that day created a lot of atheists, but i think it made a lot of atheists want to speak up a little more.

after that day, the immorality of letting religion run wild, while atheists kept quiet and enjoyed delicious potluck suppers full of community and jell-o, was inescapable.

smiling and turning the other cheek to the belief in nonsense-without-proof, while enjoying the loving culture and community, had consequences.

i'm from new england and i'll drop to my knees for community and jell-o. my dad was a christian his whole life, and my mom didn't say she was an atheist until she was in her 80s. the christians in my life have treated me wonderfully. my admitting there's no god has nothing to do with rebelling against them: i loved them then, with their honest smiles and weird-ass coffee jell-o, and still do.

but after 9/11 we had to find a way to celebrate community without condoning faith in things that can't be shared. we had to be good americans without god, and learn that we could still have our culture, our biblical references and our community, without feigning faith.

after 9/11 we could no longer pretend that faith in god was harmless. the writing had been on the wall for a while, but now the walls were a-crumblin' down and innocent people were dying. thousands of innocent people of all faiths died in that religious terrorist attack — including atheists.

some people still balk at that word. ""atheist"" is ""homosexual"" without the word ""gay"" being available. ""atheists"" suffer in this designation: it defines us by inaction.

we try other words: ""humanist,"" ""non-religious,"" ""heathen,"" ""infidel."" some of us even lie about the term ""agnostic,"" and pretend that it means ""atheist with an open mind"" or ""atheist lite,"" but it really doesn't.

""agnostic"" answers the epistemological question of how perfect knowledge can be, but once you've said you're agnostic (which every sane person is), you still have to answer the theological question about your personal belief -- and that comes down to ""atheist"" or ""theist.""

then there's the deist thang: maybe there's a force in the universe but it sure doesn't care about us as individuals and doesn't promise an afterlife. but a deist is really just an atheist before darwin.

it's possible there's always been a huge number of americans living their lives without faith in a personal god, but now we're letting our freak flags fly. we're still in the minority.

in fact it wasn't long ago that many people believed that in order to be taken seriously as a politician, you had to be a bible thumper. after all, it's been said that bill clinton gave more speeches in churches than any other president in history. many also believed the right wing was totally owned by hardcore christians, but ted cruz proved that is no longer true.

la selva biological station, costa rica (cnn) the ""blue jeans"" frog is practically screaming to be noticed. its head is blood red, and its legs are denim blue. it looks like it's wearing jeggings. but this little critter, also known as the strawberry poison dart frog, is only about the size of a fingernail. it spends most of its time either high up in the trees in this central american rainforest or rooting around in the gooey ""leaf litter"" of the forest floor.

as such, it's practically invisible.

unless you open your ears.

chit-chit-chit-chit-chit.

""it sounds like an insect. it buzzes.""

that's bryan pijanowski, a ""soundscape ecologist"" from purdue university and one of the few people paying attention to the fact that nature -- especially the amphibian part -- is growing exceptionally quiet these days. pijanowski and collaborators from around the world have been strapping audio recorders to trees here at la selva biological station in costa rica. the microphones look like funny little robots -- boxes with windscreen ears on each side.

researchers have installed microphone sensors in the rainforeset to listen for the sound of extinction.

the equipment has a critical mission.

it's listening for the sound of extinction.

have you heard it already? i ask pijanowski.

""i think so,"" he tells me. his muted, baritone voice sounds like a public radio host sharing secrets with you in a library. ""there is evidence all around the world.""

'rapid extinctions'

scientists fear earth is on the verge of the sixth era of extinction.

there have been five mass extinctions in the planet's history.

biologists fear we are on the verge of -- or have already entered -- the sixth era of extinction in earth's history.

if we usher in the sixth, three-quarters of all species could disappear in a couple of centuries, says anthony barnosky, executive director of the jasper ridge biological preserve at stanford and author of ""dodging extinction: power, food, money and the future of life on earth.""

""the best way to envision the sixth mass extinction,"" he told me, ""is to look outside and then just imagine that three out of every four of the species that were common out there are gone.""

if you study amphibians, it can seem like that dystopian future already is here.

about 10% of birds and a third of mammals are at high extinction risk.

not good.

but more than 40% of amphibians are in similar straits -- making them worse off than any other vertebrate group, according to the international union for conservation of nature.

amphibians are vanishing without warning, and often without explanation.

chytrid fungus, which humans helped spread, has decimated frog populations around the world.

""in the past 30 years or so, we've seen really dramatic, really rapid extinctions for frog populations all over the world,"" says steven whitfield, a conservation ecologist at zoo miami who joined pijanowski and me on the visit to costa rica this summer. ""many of these extinctions are due to habitat loss. but other extinctions have occurred in pristine rainforests like this -- places that look healthy but the frogs are telling us there's something clearly wrong.""

'unable to see it'

whitfield spent years studying frogs at this research station in this particular forest.

i ask him to show me how it's done.

it doesn't take long to realize it's not easy work. when whitfield conducts a study, he often ropes off a small plot of land and then spends hours searching for every single frog he can find.

the search begins with his ears.

cnn map

""i'll hear [a frog] call and spend half an hour or more looking into a small patch of vegetation, knowing that it's right there and that i need to find it but unable to see it,"" he tells me.

whitfield is an expert at pulling frog sounds out of the edm freak-out that is the rainforest. if you've been, then you know these places, in healthy conditions, are loud. i actually had a hard time falling asleep some nights in costa rica because it sounded (awesomely) like the forest was yelling at me; and i woke up early to screams of howler monkeys. (fun aside: researchers warn newcomers to always wear shoes -- because, vipers -- and to watch the trees, since the ""bullet ant,"" which delivers the world's most painful bite, like a bullet, is all around.)

whitfield's amphibian-listening powers are impressive, but even he has trouble finding frogs by sight. he takes me and a group of researchers from the center for global soundscapes deep into the forest just after dusk one evening, when some frogs tend to be the most active. our headlamps provide a washed-out sort of tunnel vision of the diversity hiding all around us.

a mexican treefrog at la selva biological station, which is a hub for field ecology.

whitfield can hear and identify frogs at great distance. there's the ""chit-chit-chit"" of the blue jeans frog (the one with jeggings), the panicked meowing of a creature aptly nicknamed the ""kitten frog."" he hears the slot-machine rattle of the ""glass frog,"" which has a translucent belly, allowing you to see organs through its skin. smoky jungle frogs scream like human babies when they're threatened, and the tink frog seems to be named for its metallic call, which sounds like that ear-piercing noise a smoke detector makes when it wants you to change its battery.

this place is way beyond ""ribbit."" the sounds are staggering.

but finding these frogs by sight?

that's more difficult.

in a couple of hours, we saw only a handful of frogs.

spiders almost seem easier to come by.

""those bite,"" whitfield says, pointing to one. ""don't touch that.""

'something is happening'

i'm grateful for the research whitfield and other field ecologists have contributed when it comes to frogs. their diligent, painstaking, searching-through-the-leaves work is how we know important (and fun) frog facts, like that the female blue jeans frog is an amphibian supermom.

a view from the forest canopy at la selva biological station in costa rica.

her tadpoles hatch on the forest floor, he says, but that's a precarious place for them, so she carries them, on her back, high up into the forest canopy, sometimes 10 to 15 meters off the ground -- about 33 to 50 feet. she drops the tadpoles off in little puddles of water up there in the forest canopy and makes a mental note of their location. she does this again and again, leaving her young all over the forest canopy. she remembers where all these tadpoles are (!!) and spends her days climbing the trees to deliver food.

""that's pretty complicated behavior for a tiny little frog,"" whitfield says.

his research also has helped show that frogs at la selva are in decline.

""we have really good long-term data on what's been happening with frog populations over four decades,"" he tells me. ""in the forest here now, there's only about 25% as many frogs as there were sustained throughout the 1970s. and for us, that's a concern because it says that something is happening to this rainforest but we don't fully understand what that is.""

the strawberry poison dart frog is sometimes called the blue jeans frog.

that's worth stating again.

locally, only a quarter of the frogs from the 1970s remain.

meanwhile, the human population jumped from less than 4 billion to 7.4 billion today.

whitfield's search-the-forest work is critical.

but even he would say it could use a technological assist.

that's where pijanowski and his tree-hugging microphones come in.

he's listening for changes whitfield might not be able to see.

'your ears ring'

bryan pijanowski is an ecologist by training. before that, he was a ""quiet alterboy-ish kind of kid"" in the midwest who also was sort of an audiophile -- and an amateur musician. he played guitar in a high school band called destruction. ""everybody wanted you to play 'freebird,'"" he said, ""so that's what i played -- over and over again.""

in school, he set out to become a medical doctor but changed his mind after hearing the ""dawn chorus"" of a swamp in michigan. he became obsessed with nature and its music.

bryan pijanowski is a ""soundscape ecologist"" from purdue university. he's also director of the center for global soundscapes.

so he studied birds and ecology, and eventually turned to ""soundscapes,"" the emerging field of using sound to understand the shifts in the health and function of ecosystems.

the work makes him so sound-focused he now has to wear earplugs to sleep.

he can't stop listening.

""there are times when [the rainforest] is almost too loud,"" he tells me.

""it's like being too close to the speakers at a concert. your ears ring.""

la selva is now one of his study sites. he's working to develop others around the world, including underwater to listen for changes to coral reefs. his microphones have taken him to the tip of south america and the deserts of mongolia. but this site is special both because the rainforest is nearly untouched -- and because there's so much data. pijanowski got his hands on recordings that date back to 2008 and started making his own recordings here in 2010. at the peak of his research, he'd installed 34 microphone sensors.

now he has 255,000 recordings here, totaling about 6.8 years of tape.

he's still analyzing the data with the help of computer algorithms.

what he's heard -- or rather, what he doesn't hear -- definitely freaks him out.

'acoustic fossils'

one evening, insects and frogs chattering outside, pijanowski sits me down in an open-window classroom at the research station and shows me some of his sound files.

he visualizes the audio in charts called spectrograms.

these charts illuminate trends that a walk through the forest can't.

take a look at this la selva recording from 2008.

and then another from 2015, recorded under similar conditions.

hear the difference?

those are just two moments.

pijanowski's team can compress a year's worth of sound into one chart.

take a look at what happens when you look at those years side by side. the red parts of the charts indicate more audible activity. the main frog frequencies grow much bluer, and quieter.

a year of audio is compressed into spectrograms. red indicates more sound coming from the forest. blue is much quieter.

it's too soon to draw scientific conclusions from this, pijanowski tells me.

but he's frightened.

""i'm worried that these would potentially become acoustic fossils,"" he says.

""in other words, the animals that are in these files are no longer alive. and the only record that we have of some of their presence is in an audio recording.

""that is somewhat disturbing to me, as a scientist and also as a citizen of this planet.""

a collaborator of pijanowski's, michael towsey, tells me he has a file of an australian frog that's thought to be extinct -- a recording that already is an acoustic fossil.

you can listen to that frog's call here on the internet.

but you can no longer hear it in nature.

'most beautiful sound in the world'

why does this matter?

there's the self-interested argument.

here's steven whitfield's take on that.

""we are all dependent on the planet for clean water, for oxygen. and ecosystems not only provide food to people but rainforests like this are an important source of medicines. some of the frogs that live in the rainforest here have chemicals in their skin that have been found to be important medicines. they can be painkillers or heart medicines. so these are things that can be really useful for medicine. and we'd like to not lose those. if we do lose those, it hurts us all.""

frog populations at la selva biological station have plunged 75% since the 1970s, according to steven whitfield, zoo miami.

there's the ecosystem collapse argument.

bryan pijanowski: ""some of the theoretical work that we're doing and ecology suggests that we could have ecosystem collapse. and that's not good ... you don't wanna start removing organisms and expect the ecosystem to survive and function in a healthy way. it could very well mean that some of the things that we are much more emotionally attached to are lost.""

that should be enough to sway a pragmatist.

still, i think there's a more human reason you should care about the disappearance of amphibians.

chances are you never or rarely see frogs in your day-to-day life. but when you learn about them -- those with translucent bellies, supermom instincts, blue-jean legs and poisonous skin, all of which are calling to be noticed by each other if not by us -- then it's hard to ignore their plight.

there are multiple causes of the amphibian apocalypse, but all the trouble points back to us. we've helped carry a killer fungus, called chytrid, around the globe, with disastrous consequences. climate change has been implicated in frog die-offs. pollution is a big problem since frogs live part-time in water and basically breathe through their skin.

they are the front lines -- the most vulnerable of species.

yet few of us seem truly outraged by their disappearance.

maybe that will change if we start listening more closely.

after all, frog choruses are some of the most fascinating songs in nature.

one recording from the island of borneo -- called ""dusk by the frog pond"" -- was voted by the always-wise internet as ""the most beautiful sound in the world.""

it's not too late to stop the sixth extinction from taking permanent hold of us, according to barnosky, the stanford researcher. we have at most 20 years to change our ways.

there's hope. but we must ditch fossil fuels, mitigating climate change. we have to stop the spread of invasive species and disease. and, in the view of one prominent biologist, we must set aside half the planet for the benefit of biodiversity and nature.

otherwise, we risk silencing the frogs.

and perhaps the rest of nature, too. THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Columbus",listening for the amphibian apocalypse

working with a san diego-based surrogacy agency, omega family global, allen was matched with a couple from china, where the use of surrogates is illegal.

jessica allen and wardell jasper with their three boys.

in april 2016, a single male embryo from the couple was implanted in allen's uterus at an irvine-based in vitro fertilization center. nine days later, blood tests confirmed the pregnancy.

unexpected news arrived six weeks later during her checkup; while examining her, her doctor said, ""well, i definitely see that there is another baby,"" she told abc news.

allen said her doctor explained to her that ""the chance of an embryo splitting is very small, but it does happen,"" and this split meant the second baby was an identical twin of the first. allen felt surprised but also happy for the chinese couple.

a bonus was that her payment was increased by $5,000 for the second child.

at 38 weeks' gestation, on december 12, 2016, allen delivered what she believed to be identical twin boys via cesarean section at riverside community hospital, she told the new york post. though she never saw the babies herself, she was shown a photo.

""i did notice one was much lighter than the other -- you know, obviously,"" she told abc news. ""they were not identical twins.""

a month later, there was some shocking news. a dna test confirmed that the second baby was not a twin to the implanted embryo -- but actually allen and her husband's biological son.

""i don't know how to describe it. we were floored. we were like, how did this happen?"" she told abc news.

omega family global's lawyer, matthew faust, said the agency is unable to address any particular facts of this story.

cnn has not been able to reach the california couple.

an unusual occurrence of superfetation might explain what happened, but one expert believes it may be more complicated than that.

rare phenomena

""superfetation is generally defined as becoming pregnant while the mother is already pregnant,"" david haig, a professor of biology at harvard university who was not involved in the surrogacy, wrote in an email. however, he added, ""the surrogacy means that it doesn't fit neatly into the classical definition of superfetation.""

superfetation is sometimes suspected when twins, at birth, are very different sizes and so apparently different ages.

in such cases, haig said, the mother is believed to have conceived a second time during an ongoing pregnancy.

""i can remember reading about an old case where the twins were delivered at different times,"" haig said. ""the mother came to the doctor with abdominal pains. he said you are in labor. she said, i cannot be -- i delivered a month ago.""

despite her protests, the twice-pregnant woman delivered a second child one month after the first, haig said.

another phenomenon, heteropaternity, occurs ""when a woman produces twins with different fathers,"" he said. sometimes, this has been called superfecundation.

in such cases, a woman would have had intercourse with two men, presumably at different times, haig explained. ""but then two eggs are fertilized by the mixed sperm within her reproductive tract,"" he added.

""this case is a bit of the mix of the two situations. i did not see a suggestion that the 'twins' were different gestational ages but they were conceived by different men and had different mothers as well.""

allen told the post that she and her husband ""did not have sexual intercourse until we were given permission by the ivf doctor, who recommended the use of condoms.""

the rare phenomenon she experienced, then, may have also included another infrequent occurrence: a condom fail.

both superfetation and heteropaternity are rare phenomena, according to haig.

part of the family

after confusion and some difficulty in getting her baby returned to her, allen and jasper were reunited with their son in february. allen told abc news that her son, renamed malachi and now 10 months old, is part of their family.

social stigma accompanies the opioid crisis and prevents many people from seeking the help they need. the popular misconception is that addiction is some sort of moral failing; that it is simply picking the wrong choice. when society insists that addiction is a choice, it perpetuates a culture of guilt and shame, which inevitably keeps addicts from seeking help.

in order to truly fight this crisis, public discourse needs to change. as leaders and citizens in cities, states and the nation realize how wide-ranging the scope of the opioid crisis is, the question of what to do next should be a key part of the health care discussion.

in 2016, more americans died from a drug overdose than died in the vietnam and iraq wars -- more than 64,000 -- combined. this sobering statistic sheds light on the fact that america is embroiled in the largest drug epidemic in us history.

for many years of my life, it seemed that i would become nothing more than a victim of my addiction. but i am one of the fortunate souls who had a chance at recovery. at 21, i was prescribed opioid pills, by a medical professional, for back pain. slowly -- but surely -- i became addicted, and in just a few years, my life was falling apart. without treatment, i would have become a part of the staggering overdose statistic.

researchers think making hiv testing available through mobile tech can prevent virus' spread

(cnn) grindr, a dating app for gay men, was found to be an effective way to give out hiv self-test kits to men at risk of infection and reduce the spread of hiv, according to a recent study.

the study targeted black and hispanic grindr users in los angeles, a high-risk population that is often untested for hiv.

gay-related and hiv-related stigma and lack of access to health care often keep these men from getting tested, according to dr. a. lina rosengren, lead author of the study and an infectious diseases fellow at the university of north carolina, chapel hill. the study says that not only are the home test kits convenient, they can help bypass some of those stigmas by providing anonymity.

with a swab of the gums, the oral fluid test kits distributed in the study deliver results in 20 minutes. if the results are positive, participants are advised to seek additional blood tests for confirmation.

researchers offered free access to these hiv home test kits through banner ads and full-screen notifications on grindr. clicking on the ads took users to the study's website, where they could choose how they want to receive the test kit: by mail, using a redeemable voucher at a local pharmacy or with a code for use at a vending machine. they were also invited to complete two surveys, an online survey at the time of the test request and a follow-up after getting tested.

usually the arms are amputated below the shoulder, sometimes below the elbow.

""it's an obscene accident. it happens more than once on the same machines in some places,"" says brother terry heinrich, one of the founders of the religious school. he counts about 20 students who have come through his classroom in about as many years with the tell-tale sign of ""the accident.""

it happened two years ago, and 25 miles from the school a catholic mission helped get him into. the memory stings.

he was 14 at the time at the time of the accident; his mother says that since the age of 11 he had been pitching in at the brick factory where his mother worked, loading bricks onto a cart and hauling them off to dry.

when she can't work anymore, she says they'll be responsible for paying off the debt she owes to the owner of the factory where she works.

she says that 15 years ago she took a $12 loan from a brick factory owner that has ballooned to $2,800-worth of debt.

over the years, she moved between different brick-making factories. each time, she says, the new owner bought the debt she owed the previous owner. and then she'd owe a little bit more.

like other brick kiln workers, she's paid by the brick. she says that much of her meager wages must go toward paying off the debt; there's barely any money to survive on. when there's not enough for necessities, she has to borrow more.

""this is the life of a brick kiln worker,"" she says.

to make more bricks, and earn more money, mok thy says it's typical for parents working at brick kilns to put their children to work alongside them.

at brick factories outside of phnom penh, cnn saw children involved in the brick-making process.

'a sense of hopelessness'

in 2016, a cambodian ngo called licadho sent researchers to dozens of brick kilns outside of phnom penh after being contacted by a group of families whose children were injured in accidents similar to chantheng's.

""often there's a sense of guilt [for the families and the children], there's a sense of hopelessness, there's depression, there's bullying by other kids and parents and other people who don't understand -- and there's lifetime pain depending on where the injury is,"" says naly pilorge, the deputy director of advocacy for licadho.

in december 2016, licadho published a report determining that the risk of injuries to children in the kilns remains high. the same report alleges widespread abuses including child labor and bonded labor in the brick factories that are doing big business, fueling cambodia's building boom. the us state department considers bonded labor to be a form of modern slavery.

cambodia's labor ministry refutes the findings of the licadho report. child labor and bonded labor are illegal under cambodian law.

the law isn't being enforced, according to pilorge. ""[entire families] are just working. working nonstop. whatever money they get barely covers their food. it doesn't make any difference towards reduction of their debt.

""what we found is not only that children were working besides dangerous machinery but we were also finding out that entire families were coerced or forced or tricked into bonded labor.""

just watched working off debt in cambodia's brick kilns replay more videos ... must watch working off debt in cambodia's brick kilns 02:45

cnn visited brick kilns where workers said their debt to factory owners ranged from hundreds to thousands of us dollars. the going rate per brick is a fraction of a cent according to licadho. the equation makes it impossible for workers to pay down debt while earning enough for basics.

but the labor ministry insists the illegal practice of debt bondage isn't flourishing in the kilns as licadho claims; in fact, the ministry says the practice doesn't exist at all.

""debt bondage is the direct debt between employer and workers. this is debt borrowing,"" insists veng heang, director of the labor ministry's child labor department.

veng calls it a legal system of advance loans, but he says the distinction from debt bondage is ""confusing"" and for that reason, the practice should stop. one brick kiln owner we spoke to on the outskirts on phnom penh told us all her workers owe her money, because she gives them advance loans for things like weddings and to cover the expense of births.

""their lives here are good because the bills are put on me,"" she says. ""when they give birth, we pay; when they get married, we also pay. so their debts increase because they borrow our money.""

veng also says a successful government campaign against child labor has wiped out the problem in the kilns entirely. the success, he says, started with a campaign to get children out of the kilns launched back in 2006.

six hundred government employees are assigned to inspect nearly 400 brick kilns. the labor ministry says they haven't identified a single case that qualifies as child labor since 2012.

children in the kilns

during the week that a cnn crew spent filming at brick factories outside of phnom penh, we saw children involved with various steps of the brick-making process, in every factory we visited. we can't verify the ages of some of the children, or if the type of work they were doing would be considered illegal.

all the children we met said they were helping out their families without being paid.

the labor ministry responded by saying that workers may be older than they look and that while labor is illegal for children under 15, light work is allowed for children aged 12 and over.

that's not the kind of work chantheng was doing two years ago. his mother no longer works on the machine that scarred her son. she's moved on to another kiln where she spends her days hauling carts weighed down with bricks.

THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Columbus","(cnn) when was the last time you dusted your house?

your answer could reveal a lot about your home habits, but the findings of a new study might have everyone upping their game -- and potentially keeping wet wipes and hand sanitizer nearby at all times.

researchers at george washington university say 45 toxic chemicals are found commonly in your house dust, with 10 of them lurking in 90% of homes across the country.

""we wanted to identify which chemicals were present at the highest exposure in homes,"" said dr. ami zota , an assistant professor of environmental occupational health who led the study. ""some chemicals were in virtually every dust sample.""

to reveal which potential toxins we're being exposed to in the comfort of our own homes, zota's team analyzed all studies that have sampled indoor environments in the united states since 2000. they looked for the presence of potentially toxic chemicals and divided them into five classes of chemicals, two of which were found to be more common than the rest: phthalates and flame retardants.

""many of the top 10 fall into these two categories,"" zota said.

but when factoring in the wide range of chemicals we're exposed to, small amounts can add up, she stressed.

lurking in the dust

the chemicals found in dust samples came from a range of things typically found inside your home, including vinyl products -- such as flooring -- cosmetics, baby products, furniture and nail polish.

to understand how these chemicals are entering your home, it helps to understand where they are used. phthalates make plastic softer and more flexible, so they tend to be found in vinyl (pvc) materials such as flooring, blinds and food packaging. flame retardants help products meet flammability standards that are built into building codes, insurance requirements and fire regulations.

the other three classes of chemicals found in dust samples included environmental phenols, usually used as preservatives in personal care products like shampoo; fluorinated chemicals, used as stain- and water-repellent treatments for upholstery, carpets and clothes and in nonstick pans; and fragrances.

only one chemical used in fragrances had been the topic of a study, meaning many more chemicals are likely to be present in dust with little insight into them, according to the researchers. ""we know very little about the health hazard of these fragrances,"" said zota.

but the researchers note that it is about more than exposure. for example, phthalates were detected in the highest concentrations in the study, but the chemicals found in flame retardants had the ""highest estimated intake,"" meaning they are more likely to enter the body.

""you can breathe it in and can absorb into your skin,"" zota said. ""these chemicals are not bound to the products, so they can migrate out.""

a risk to child development

one of the biggest concerns underlying the presence of these chemicals hiding in house dust is the fact that children are most likely to inhale or ingest them as they crawl around, touching things and inevitably placing their hands in their mouths multiple times a day.

""environmental insults during early development can have long-lasting adverse health effects that persist across the lifespan,"" zota said. phthalate exposure in children ""can increase risk of respiratory, behavioral and neurodevelopmental problems.""

phthalates are also known to disrupt hormones inside the body, meaning they could cause reproductive problems.

""we know from lead that exposures are not acceptable,"" said dr. asa bradman, associate director for exposure assessment at the center for environmental research and child's health at the university of california, berkeley, who was not involved in the new study.

""there's a strong argument to reduce exposure to children whose brains are changing and bodies are developing.""

as for the study findings, bradman noted that the reason phthalates were found to be most common in house dust was probably because most studies have been done on this class of chemicals.

""by compiling information in this way, there's always the possibility of exposures that haven't been studied yet,"" bradman said.

preventing exposure

some advice to prevent exposure, other than regularly dusting your home, is to veer away from the traditional feather duster and use a powerful vacuum with a hepa filter to ensure that all dust particles are sucked up. regular hand-washing -- which has a multitude of benefits -- will also reduce exposure to flame retardants found on the surfaces of furniture.

the silent spring institute has created an app to help people understand more about their environmental exposures, aptly named detox me

but both zota and bradman stress that there needs to be more research into the range of chemicals people are exposed to at home and changes at the policy level to reduce the number of chemicals entering people's households, through bans, better regulation and improved underlying chemistry during production.

""there may be chemicals out there that we don't know about, that we should know about,"" said bradman, whose own research looks into exposure risks, particularly among children. his studies have found phthalates to be common in child care practices in the united states.

""but we can also reformulate materials so that chemicals don't just go into our bodies,"" he added. ""there may be ways to have better adhesion [of flame retardants to furnishings] so they don't get into the environment.""

the issue is also not specific to the united states.

""these consumer product chemicals are widely used throughout the globe and have been detected in homes in the uk and other european countries,"" zota said, adding, ""since the european union has different chemical regulations than the us, the average levels for some of the chemicals may be different than those we found for us homes.""

spokeswomen for the florida department of health and the agency for health care administration did not respond directly to gilmer's criticism. THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Jacksonville","st. augustine, florida (cnn) when he was 11 years old, lj stroud of st. augustine, florida, had a tooth emerge in a place where no tooth belongs: the roof of his mouth.

lj was born with severe cleft lip and palate, which explained the strange eruption, as well as the constant ear infections that no antibiotic could remedy.

with her son in terrible pain, meredith stroud arranged for surgeries to fix his problems.

but just days before the procedures were to take place, the surgeons' office called to cancel them.

like nearly half of all children in florida, lj is on medicaid, which has several types of insurance plans. the state had switched lj to a new plan, and his surgeons didn't take it.

lj wasn't alone. in the spring and summer of 2015, the state switched more than 13,000 children out of a highly respected program called children's medical services, or cms, a part of florida medicaid. children on this plan have serious health problems including birth defects, heart disease, diabetes and blindness.

the state moved the children to other medicaid insurance plans that don't specialize in caring for very sick children.

stroud says that for her son, the consequences were devastating. despite hours of phone calls, she says, she couldn't find surgeons on his new insurance plan willing to do the highly specialized procedures he needed. over the next seven months, her son lost 10 pounds, quit the football team and often missed school.

""he was in pain every day,"" stroud said. ""i just felt so helpless. it's such a horrible feeling where you can't help your kid.""

lj filed a lawsuit against the state of florida, and he was eventually placed back on children's medical services and received the care he needed. but some florida pediatricians worry about other children with special health care needs who, two years later, are still off the program.

the doctors aren't just worried; they're angry.

first, the data analysis the state used to justify switching the children is ""inaccurate"" and ""bizarre,"" according to the researcher who wrote the software used in that analysis.

second, the screening tool the state used to select which children would be kicked off the program has been called ""completely invalid"" and ""a perversion of science"" by top experts in children with special health care needs.

third, in fall 2015, a state administrative law judge ruled that the department of health should stop using the screening tool because it was unlawful. however, even after the judge issued his decision, the department didn't automatically re-enroll the children or even reach out to the families directly to let them know that re-enrollment was a possibility.

finally, parents and florida pediatricians raise questions about the true reasons why florida's republican administration switched the children's health plans. they question whether it was to financially reward insurance companies that had donated millions of dollars to the republican party of florida.

""this was a way for the politicians to repay the entities that had contributed to their political campaigns and their political success, and it's the children who suffered,"" said dr. louis st. petery, former executive vice president of the florida chapter of the american academy of pediatrics.

experts outside florida are also disturbed that the children were switched out of cms, a program that's served as a model for other states for more than 40 years.

""cms is well-known and well-respected,"" said dr. james perrin, professor of pediatrics at harvard medical school. ""it's one of the earlier programs to build in assurances that these kids get the kind of care they need.""

""these are the sickest and most vulnerable kids, and (changing their insurance) can mean life or death for them,"" said joan alker, executive director of the center for children and families at georgetown university. ""this is really very troubling.""

dr. rishi agrawal, an associate professor of pediatrics at northwestern university's feinberg school of medicine, agreed, adding that florida should have more carefully considered how the insurance switch would affect the children's health care.

""the process in florida was particularly abrupt and poorly executed,"" he said.

mara gambineri, a spokeswoman for the florida department of health, said that ""at no time (during the insurance switch) did children go without medically necessary services.""

state officials, including a spokesman for governor rick scott's office, initially declined to comment directly on the pediatricians' and parents' concerns that the children might have been switched to benefit contributors to the republican party of florida. on friday, after this story was published, the florida department of health released a statement asserting that such a claim ""is 100 percent false.""

""the department's number one priority is protecting the health and well-being of all florida residents, especially children with special health care needs,"" gambineri wrote in an earlier email. ""the department remains committed to providing quality health care services to florida's children with special health care needs.""

a mother's anguish

in spring 2015, lj's mother received a phone call from a nurse at the florida department of health.

stroud had no idea that one word she would say to that nurse -- just one single word -- would cause her son months of pain and suffering.

meredith stroud's son, lj, was born with cleft lip and palate. he lost his children's medical service coverage when he was 11.

the nurse asked stroud a series of questions, including whether lj was limited in his ability to do things other children could do.

despite his birth defect, lj goes to school and plays with friends, so she answered no.

stroud says that because of that answer, lj lost his insurance with cms, the program that has cared for children with special health care needs in florida for 40 years, and was put on a different medicaid insurance plan.

lj was one of 13,074 florida children kicked off cms -- that's about one in five children in the program -- as a result of the telephone survey, according to a presentation testimony and a letter from florida's top health officials.

stroud thinks back to her answer to the nurse's question about limitations.

""that question's not fair,"" stroud said of the one that got her child kicked off cms. ""what [the florida department of health] did was totally wrong.""

""it was a trick question,"" she added.

pediatrician: 'a truly duplicitous question'

experts agree with her.

""i personally find it pretty astonishing that they can take a survey question like that and use it to justify the de-enrolling of these kids,"" said dr. jay berry, an assistant professor of pediatrics at harvard medical school who studies policies for children with special health care needs.

what florida did was ""completely invalid,"" added dr. john neff, professor emeritus of pediatrics at the university of washington, another expert on children with special health care needs.

the pediatricians explained that many children with serious and chronic medical conditions -- such as cleft lip and palate, hiv, diabetes and cystic fibrosis -- are often able to do things other children can do. however, they still require extensive and highly specialized medical care.

the question the florida department of health nurses asked -- ""is your child limited or prevented in any way in his or her ability to do the things most children of the same age can do?"" -- would lead to disqualifying children who truly have special medical needs from a program designed for them, said stephen blumberg, associate director for science at the national center for health statistics and one of the world's leading experts on the epidemiology of children with special health care needs.

question no. 3 ""is your child limited or prevented in any way in his or her ability to do the things most children of the same age can do?""

""you would get false negatives. your conclusion would be that a child does not have special health care needs when, in fact, the child does,"" he added.

the department of health no longer uses the same screening method that resulted in 13,074 children being removed from cms.

""it is unfortunate the negativity surrounding this issue is a continued topic of inquiry, as the department and our stakeholders have put in a significant amount of time and effort to move past this issue for the benefit of the children we serve,"" wrote gambineri, the department of health spokeswoman.

but pediatricians in florida point out that many children who were removed from children's medical services using the controversial questionnaire were never put back on.

""this was a truly duplicitous question,"" said dr. philip colaizzo, a pediatrician in jupiter, florida, who said that many of his patients with special health care needs were taken off cms. ""it was a trick question.""

""it's a perversion of science,"" said dr. jeffrey goldhagen, professor of pediatrics at the university of florida college of medicine and medical director of the bower lyman center for medically complex children at wolfson children's hospital.

goldhagen added that he was speaking for himself and not the institutions where he works.

""it was a scam job,"" added dr. nancy wright, a pediatric endocrinologist in tallahassee who said that dozens of her patients with diabetes were removed from the program.

dr. nancy wright, a pediatric endocrinologist, says dozens of her patients lost their coverage on children's medical services. ""for the children with diabetes that i work with, it was a disaster,"" she said.

""they really tried their darnedest to kick the kids out of cms,"" added dr. carrol fenn, an orthodontist in west palm beach. ""they've messed up kids' lives.""

""they're the most vulnerable of our population, and that they can be booted off the plan that was designed to help them is just amazing. how can someone in an office make a decision like that?"" asked dr. john obi, an adjunct clinical professor in plastic surgery at the university of florida, who operates on children with cleft lip and palate.

""i congratulate whoever came up with that question,"" he added wryly. ""if you want to exclude virtually anybody, that's the way to do it.""

johns hopkins expert: 'i'm speechless'

christina bethell's team came up with that question -- and she's furious.

bethell is a professor at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health. she and her team spent many years and millions of dollars coming up with the right questions to accurately identify children across the united states who might have special health care needs.

the list of questions -- known as the children with special health care needs screener -- is publicly available on the hopkins website. many state and federal agencies use it to help decide which children might benefit from special health services.

the florida department of health, however, used the questions to do something completely different: to kick children out of a program.

that's scientifically invalid, bethell said. using the questions that way -- especially the question about limitations -- would lead to denying children with special health care needs the services they require.

""i'm speechless,"" she said.

to make matters worse, bethell said, florida repeatedly and publicly cited research done by her group at hopkins -- the children and adolescent health measurement initiative -- to support the children's removal from cms.

""i feel really manipulated,"" she said.

she thinks of the children who were taken off cms and fumes that the tool used to remove them was her own work.

""i'm angry,"" she said. ""and i'm crestfallen for these families.""

grave consequences for florida children

the shabanehs in tallahassee are one of those families.

aref shabaneh, 8, is blind, and his sister, yasmeen, 11, is severely visually impaired. their mother, reema shabaneh, says they were kicked off cms in 2015.

shabaneh says she told the florida department of health nurse that they didn't have limitations.

""aref wants to do everything by himself,"" she said. ""he can play ball with friends. the ball has a bell, so he can hear it coming.""

after they were kicked off cms, shabaneh said, she couldn't find an ophthalmologist on the new insurance plan willing to care for her children.

""i was so scared,"" she said.

when jennifer rodriguez received the phone call from the department of health nurse, she said, she told the nurse she didn't know how to answer the question about limitations. her son, alejandro, suffers from a congenital heart defect, asthma and kidney problems. sometimes, his heart races and he has trouble breathing, but other times, he feels up to playing soccer with his friends.

""when i tried to explain the answer, she cut me off and said she was just doing her job and needed a yes or a no,"" she said.

rodriguez says she answered that her son, who was 10 at the time, did not have limitations. he then lost his cms coverage.

""it makes me angry, because you would think that since he's seeing a cardiologist, a nephrologist, a urologist and an asthma doctor, they would see he's not your average child,"" she said.

lj, alejandro and the shabaneh children filed lawsuits and were put back on cms. they were represented by the public interest law center at florida state university.

alejandro rodriguez wears a nebulizer mask to help him breathe. after he filed a lawsuit, the state put him back on children's medical services.

many florida pediatricians say their patients also suffered when they were taken off cms and put on other medicaid plans. the doctors say those other plans typically have fewer pediatric specialists than cms, which specializes in caring for very sick children.

dr. lisa cosgrove, a pediatrician in merritt island, florida, said she had a difficult time finding an orthopedist to treat a 6-year-old with a broken elbow who had been taken off cms. the girl ended up having surgery later than she should have and now can't extend her elbow all the way.

she said a baby born with a clubfoot also suffered because she couldn't find an orthopedist willing to take the baby's plan. the baby couldn't have the necessary casts to twist the foot back into place and may need surgery, cosgrove said.

dr. elizabeth curry, a pediatrician in port st. joe, florida, said that last year, she took care of a baby whose eye wiggled back and forth involuntarily, which can be a sign of a brain tumor.

curry said it took her more than a month to find an ophthalmologist willing to take the baby's medicaid plan -- and the doctor she finally found was three hours away, in pensacola.

fortunately, the baby turned out to be fine.

""this child could have had cancer. that's a kid who should have seen a doctor right away,"" curry said. ""i feel terrible for these children. it makes me so angry.""

dr. elizabeth curry, a florida pediatrician, says some of her patients didn't get the treatment they needed because the state had removed them from children's medical services.

because of problems like these, switching the children's insurance ""was a complete dereliction of florida's responsibility to children,"" said goldhagen, the professor of pediatrics at the university of florida college of medicine.

gambineri, the spokeswoman for the florida department of health, said the children didn't suffer as a result of the switch, because the insurance plans they were moved to were ""more than capable"" of caring for them. she added that even before the 13,074 children were switched, those plans cared for tens of thousands of children with special health needs.

other pediatricians agree that plans besides cms have done a good job of caring for these very sick children.

the other plans ""do a pretty good job with our families,"" said dr. karalee kulek-luzey, medical director of the pediatric health care alliance, a group practice with multiple locations in the tampa area. ""they're working really hard.""

""for the most part, they do a good job,"" said dr. michael freimark, a pediatrician in plantation, florida.

""we have a good relationship with the plans,"" said dr. michael gervasi, president and chief executive officer of the florida community health centers, a large medical practice with offices in several counties. most of the time, he said, the plans take care of the children's needs, but if there's ever a problem, his practice contacts the plan, and they fix it.

aref's older sister, yasmeen shabaneh, was also was removed from children's medical services. she has a vision condition so serious that even a minor bump could cause her retinas to detach.

florida's 'outreach' to experts

in january 2016, about eight months after the florida department of health started to move the 13,074 children out of cms, jennifer tschetter, then the department's chief operating officer, testified before the state legislature. she said that the decision to use the hopkins screening tool was made ""in consultation with ... national experts.""

but it remains unclear who those experts were.

tschetter, who has since left state government, did not respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment.

gambineri, the florida health department spokeswoman, said the department did ""research"" into what louisiana, california, texas and new york ""were doing and experiences they had in regard to clinical eligibility for children with special health care needs.""

when asked for the names of individuals florida consulted in those states, gambineri didn't respond.

gambineri added that ""outreach"" was made to the federal health resources and services administration.

an official at that agency said she spoke with a florida health official.

dr. marie mann, senior medical adviser in the division of services for children with special health needs at the federal agency's maternal and child health bureau, said she spoke with kelli stannard, then interim chief, bureau of network operations, at cms.

mann says she told stannard she couldn't give her any guidance.

""i told her i was not in a position to provide advice,"" mann said.

mann said she suggested that florida health officials reach out to daniel armstrong and dr. jeffrey brosco, director and associate director respectively of the mailman center for child development at the university of miami miller school of medicine.

""we will make sure they're both involved in this review process,"" stannard wrote back to mann in an email obtained by cnn under the freedom of information act.

cnn asked gambineri, the department spokeswoman, whether the department ever reached out to armstrong to review and make recommendations on using the telephone survey to screen children out of cms.

""not to our knowledge,"" gambineri answered.

""i played no role in the decision-making process related to the use of the tool for the children's medical services program,"" armstrong wrote in an email to cnn.

brosco said he told the department of health that in his opinion, a child should not be kicked off cms based on a parent's answer to the question about the child's limitations.

""i gave them my feedback, and they said, 'thank you for your work,' "" brosco said.

in july, brosco was named the florida department of health's deputy secretary for cms.

christmas shopping at the florida mall

despite the lack of support from the very experts they'd consulted, florida health officials forged ahead with using the phone survey to disqualify children from cms.

they had a schedule to stick to.

in november 2014, state officials set out to ""go live"" with the phone survey in six months, according to a timeline developed by the state and obtained by cnn under the freedom of information act.

before implementing the surveys, the officials gave themselves 21 days to ""solicit feedback from the field"" about the questions they would ask the parents.

one of the first things they did was to ask one of the state's most experienced pediatricians to leave a meeting.

it was st. petery, who at the time was the executive vice president of the florida chapter of the american academy of pediatrics and who has an encyclopedic knowledge of medicaid rules and regulations. he'd served as interim director of cms for six months during the mid-1970s.

he'd also been a thorn in the side of the state department of health for years. he'd been instrumental in a lawsuit that accused the state of failing to reimburse doctors properly in the medicaid program and to ensure that children receive adequate care.

his side eventually won that lawsuit, and the american academy of pediatrics gave him a prestigious award for being ""a tireless advocate for children's health and well-being.""

dr. louis st. petery, a pediatric cardiologist and frequent critic of florida's health policy, was asked to leave a state meeting where children's medical services screening was discussed.

on december 13, 2014, st. petery showed up at the department of health meeting. it was for the regional medical directors of cms, the group of pediatricians who help run the program. st. petery wasn't one of the directors, but he'd been attending their meetings for many years in his role with the florida chapter of the american academy of pediatrics.

st. petery said that just before the meeting started, tschetter, then the department's chief operating officer, approached him.

""she said, didn't i want to go christmas shopping at the florida mall?"" st. petery remembered. the mall was adjacent to the conference center in orlando where the meeting was taking place.

st. petery said he told tschetter that he hates shopping, especially around the holidays, and wanted to stay at the meeting.

""i protested. i asked her, is this meeting not in the sunshine?"" he said, referring to florida's sunshine law, which gives the public the right to access most government meetings.

""after she told me for the third time to leave, i decided not to create a scene,"" he said.

st. petery got up and left.

other doctors watched the action, stunned.

""we were all kind of shaking,"" said dr. barbara rumberger, one of the cms regional medical directors who attended the meeting.

after st. petery departed, health officials explained that they would start screening children off of cms. their justification: a new analysis showing that half the children on cms might not belong there.

there are no minutes for this meeting, according to department of health officials, but a year later, tschetter presented similar data to the florida legislature.

a 'totally inaccurate' analysis

by florida law , a child can be in cms only if he or she has a ""chronic and serious"" condition requiring health care ""of a type or amount beyond that which is generally required by children.""

the analysis tschetter presented showed that about half of the children on cms had lower than average risk scores, an assessment of how much a patient uses health care services.

tschetter called these results ""surprising."" by legislative mandate, children on cms are supposed to have health needs greater those of other children.

""the analysis made clear, certainly to the department, that we were not meeting legislative direction: (that) the children in the plan have both chronic and serious health care conditions,"" tschetter told legislators. ""it was clear to the department that something had to be done, because complying with legislative direction is certainly not optional.""

but an expert who developed the software florida used to make that data analysis said the state did its calculations incorrectly.

""it was clear to the department that something had to be done."" jennifer tschetter, former chief operating officer, florida department of health

""it's totally inaccurate,"" said todd gilmer, co-developer of the chronic illness and disability payment system and chief of the division of health policy at the university of california, san diego.

gilmer's software, which is used by dozens of state medicaid programs, tracks patients' diagnoses and their prescription drug use to calculate risk scores for each individual.

after viewing florida officials' analysis of the data, he said they made two errors when they calculated that half the children on cms had below-average risk scores.

first, he explained that his software relies on doctors' diagnoses, and florida failed to account for the fact that doctors frequently don't document a child's full diagnosis in the medical record. for example, if a quadriplegic child goes to the doctor because of bedsores, doctors often write down the reason the child came in -- the bedsores -- instead of the more serious diagnosis of quadriplegia.

second, he said, florida did the wrong calculation for disabled children, who represent 40% of the patients on cms, according to mallory mcmanus, a spokeswoman for florida's agency for health care administration.

he said his software compares disabled children with each other. even the ones who fall in the lower half of the risk-score spectrum still have serious and chronic illnesses, he said, such as hiv or heart failure.

he said that what florida did was akin to assembling a group of people who are over 7 feet tall and calling the bottom half of that group short.

gilmer called florida's analysis ""kind of bizarre"" and said he was disappointed to see his software ""misapplied"" by the florida department of health.

spokeswomen for the florida department of health and the agency for health care administration did not respond directly to gilmer's criticism.

gambineri, the health department spokeswoman, said that the department no longer uses the screening method that it used in 2015 and that parents can ask to have their children re-screened at any time.

""our mission is now and has always been to provide the best health care possible to the populations that we serve,"" mcmanus wrote in an email.

pediatrician: 'we were just irrelevant'

pediatricians say that by the time the department of health meeting was held at the orlando conference center at the end of 2014, they felt like florida was dead-set on screening a large number of children off cms.

they said state officials didn't listen to their concerns, even though they were stated repeatedly, both in person and in writing.

at the meeting, health officials asked the pediatricians to tell them what was on their minds, according to rumberger, one of the doctors who was there.

she said she and her colleagues brought up concerns that children might be taken off cms inappropriately.

the department of health official wrote down what the doctors said on pieces of paper taped to the wall, rumberger said. the official then told the doctors that these were issues to discuss at another time.

""she said, 'we're going to park these. we're putting these ideas in the parking lot for some time, and we're not talking about these things today,' "" rumberger remembered, adding that she was speaking on behalf of herself and not in her role as a cms regional medical director.

""we were all amazed at what they did,"" she added.

a few months later, the state held a series of telephone conference calls with the same cms regional medical directors.

""they didn't ask us 'what do you think?' or 'do you have any suggestions?' "" rumberger said. ""it was just 'this is how we're going to do it.' it was clear they didn't want to have a free discussion.""

""it appears to be a very conscious decision to not get input and not receive any dissension,"" said goldhagen, the professor of pediatrics at the university of florida. ""we were just irrelevant.""

dr. rex northup, another cms regional medical director and associate professor of pediatrics at the university of florida college of medicine, agrees.

""it was like, 'when we want your opinion on a given topic, we'll let you know, and we'll provide that opinion to you,' "" northup said, adding that he speaks for himself and not the university or any other institution.

several doctors present on those conference calls said they voiced their concerns anyway.

there's no record of these concerns. according to the florida department of health, no minutes were taken of these phone conferences.

cnn asked the florida department of health about the meeting where st. petery was asked to leave and about doctors' complaints that the state steamrolled through a screening tool that would harm sick children.

""when cms began the process of implementing a new screening tool in 2014, the department may have underestimated the need for stakeholder input and the time required to obtain feedback and ensure our community was comfortable with the mechanisms for determining clinical eligibility,"" responded gambineri, the department of health spokeswoman.

she added that the department has ""engaged our stakeholders using several methods"" including public meetings to solicit input from patients, parents and providers and ""remains open to feedback and input in order to best serve children with serious and chronic medical conditions.""

true to its schedule, the state started screening children off cms in may 2015.

florida pediatricians repeatedly told the state that it was hurting sick, vulnerable children.

in august 2015, goldhagen, rumberger, northup and 11 other doctors with positions at cms wrote a letter to a department of health official saying the screening process was ""flawed"" and was removing too many children.

the doctors did not receive a response, goldhagen said.

two months later, st. petery wrote to department of health officials, sharply criticizing the use of the screening tool.

he said he never received a response, either.

dr. elizabeth curry, examining micah creamer, says she wrote to the florida agency for health care administration, expressing her concerns about patients being kicked off children's medical services, but the agency didn't respond.

curry, the port saint joe pediatrician who practices in a rural area of the florida panhandle, said she also complained to the state's agency for health care administration about children being kicked off cms, along with other issues affecting children on medicaid.

she said the agency worked with her on some of the other issues but didn't respond to her complaints about the children being taken off cms.

""our agency has been in contact with the provider and is working with the health plan to resolve what issues might be resolved,"" wrote mcmanus, the agency spokeswoman.

curry said she took her complaints even higher.

""i even called the governor's office once and left a message,"" she said. ""i admit that i finally gave up. i'm just trying to take care of my patients.""

pediatricians interviewed for this story said they felt pressure from the state not to speak to the media about the removal of the children from cms.

on november 15, 2016, dr. john curran, then the florida department of health's deputy secretary for cms, said on a conference call that a cnn reporter was working on this story, according to several doctors on the call.

that evening, a department official wrote an email to the doctors who'd been on the call. it advised these pediatricians that prior to responding to media inquiries, they should contact the department's communications director.

""i'm going to be so fired for saying all these things,"" rumberger said.

but she and other pediatricians say they're speaking up because they feel that the department of health hurt children because they didn't listen to their concerns.

they say it could be because pediatricians don't tend to have millions of dollars to donate to political campaigns.

but insurance companies do.

'like a plot in a carl hiaasen novel'

all of this -- the telephone survey, the question about limitations, the analysis that's been called flawed -- leaves many florida parents and pediatricians suspicious about why the state wanted to take 13,074 children off cms and why it worked so hard and so quickly to do it.

switching the children from cms to the other medicaid plans didn't save taxpayers money, according to mcmanus, the agency spokeswoman.

the doctors wonder, then, whether the inspiration for the change was political: to send taxpayers' dollars to generous donors to the florida republican party.

cms is a public program; it's not owned by a private insurance company.

when the children were taken off cms, they were switched to 11 insurance plans that are owned by private companies. the parent companies of nine of those 11 plans donated a total of more than $8 million to florida republican party committees in the five years before the children were switched.

""i knew it had to be about money,"" said wright, the pediatric endocrinologist in tallahassee who said that dozens of her patients had their insurance switched. ""this sounds very believable for florida, and i'm from florida.""

""when this was all unfolding, i told my office manager, 'i feel like we're in a plot in a carl hiaasen novel,' "" she added, referring to the miami herald columnist who writes about politics and corruption in florida.

dr. nancy wright, a pediatric endocrinologist, says she thinks the state's motivation for taking patients off children's medical services ""appears to be about money. ... it's clearly not medical.""

the companies that own the nine insurance plans contributed $8.6 million to florida republican party committees from 2010 to 2014, according to an analysis done for cnn by the national institute on money in state politics , a nonpartisan nonprofit group.

here's a breakdown of how much money each insurance company with a medicaid contract contributed to florida republican party committees from 2010 to 2014:

$5.9 million from blue cross and blue shield of florida. florida true health is an affiliate of blue cross and blue shield of florida. at the time the money was contributed, florida true health owned 40% of prestige health choice, which has a medicaid contract with the state of florida. in 2015, florida true health purchased prestige outright.

contributions between $232,500 and $668,082 from each of six insurance plans and their parent companies that have contracts with florida medicaid: amerigroup, unitedhealthcare of florida, humana, sunshine state health plan, aetna and wellcare. wellcare's florida medicaid policy is marketed under the name staywell.

$90,000 from simply health, which owns a medicaid plan called better health.

$849,433 from miguel fernandez, the former chairman of simply health. in addition, fernandez donated about $1.3 million to scott's let's get to work political action committee from 2010 to 2014.

insurance companies' outsize contributions to florida republicans

nearly all states pay insurance companies to insure some of their medicaid patients; this is not unique to florida.

and insurance companies often contribute money to state political parties. that's not unique to florida, either.

what is unusual is the size of the contributions, even for a large state.

take unitedhealthcare, an insurance giant with business in all 50 states. from 2010 to 2014, united contributed $442,500 to florida republican party committees, according to the national institute on money in state politics.

the company's next largest contribution to any other state political party was $145,000 to california democrats -- less than half the florida amount.

humana, another insurance company with a national reach, gave substantially more money to florida republican party committees than to any other state political party committees.

from 2010 to 2014, humana donated $482,815 to florida republican party committees. its next largest contribution was $213,823 to florida democrats. the next largest contribution after that was $22,000 to the illinois gop, less than one-20th the size of the contribution to florida republicans.

blue cross and blue shield of florida gave florida republican party committees $5.9 million from 2010 to 2014 and gave florida democrats $1.8 million . the next largest contribution after that from any other blue cross and blue shield company in the united states was $730,696 from blue shield of california to democrats in that state -- about one-eighth the size of the contribution to florida republicans.

florida's payments to the insurance companies

nearly all states pay private insurance companies monthly premiums to insure medicaid patients. it's become big business.

the florida department of health declined to say how much it paid the private insurance companies to insure the 13,074 children when they were switched out of cms.

""if they got 13,000 new kids, (it's) that times however many dollars per member per month,"" st. petery said. ""i think that's a lot of money when you start talking about that many kids.""

lj stroud sued the state of florida to be put back on children's medical services. he has now had the procedures that he needs.

these children came from cms, a medicaid program for sick children, and the state pays insurance companies more money to care for such children.

this is how it works, according to mcmanus, the spokeswoman for the florida agency for health care administration.

florida takes a look at all the people who've signed up with an insurance company and calculates a risk score for that group based on factors such as the age of the enrollees in the plan and their health conditions.

a plan with the lowest risk score has a ""typical population"" and might be paid a rate of, for example, $320 per person per month, mcmanus said. a plan with sicker enrollees might have a risk score that's twice as high and so would be paid $640 per person per month, she added.

the numbers can get even higher from there.

""the state will pay a pretty good rate for these children,"" said agrawal, the pediatrician at northwestern who studies health care systems for children with special medical needs.

""they could get paid thousands more per month for a child with serious medical needs,"" said steve schramm, founder and managing director of optumas, a health care consulting group.

""the enhanced reimbursement may be 10 times what the insurance companies get for a well child,"" said goldhagen, former director of florida's duval county health department.

yasmeen shabaneh sued florida and was placed back on children's medical services.

sick children are, of course, also costlier for insurance companies because they need more care. but insurance plans monitor that care to manage costs.

""plans have gotten very sophisticated in their ability to manage very sick kids, so their willingness to take very sick kids is great,"" said jeff myers, president and ceo of medicaid health plans of america, an industry group representing insurance companies.

pediatricians questioned whether such outsize political donations were an attempt to gain influence and favor with florida's republican administration, which orchestrated the transfer of the children out of cms and to the private companies.

""it certainly raises a lot of suspicion and concern,"" said northup, the associate professor at the university of florida college of medicine.

""why would they make contributions in the hundreds of thousands and the millions to florida republicans? why would they be so uniquely committed to republicans in florida? it gives one pause,"" he added. ""if you follow the money, at the very least, it's worrisome.""

""it's the left-hand-washing-the-right-hand kind of business,"" said dr. joseph chiaro, who was florida's deputy secretary of health from 2005 to 2011. ""it breaks my heart.""

six florida pediatricians gathered in orlando to tell cnn their concerns. they practice in rural, suburban and urban areas. some of them are republicans, and others are democrats.

they said they feared that big donors had influence on the state's decision-making process and that in many cases, the children suffered as a result.

""i don't see this in writing anywhere, but my impression is, this was a way for political payback at the expense of the sickest of the medicaid children,"" st. petery said.

""it just comes back to money or power. it's not about health care for the children,"" said wright, the pediatric endocrinologist in tallahassee.

""just follow the money,"" said colaizzo, who runs a rural health care clinic in pahokee, florida.

state leaders ""don't give a damn about the kids. they don't give a damn about the families,"" said dr. marcy howard, a pediatrician in crystal river, florida.

state officials and insurance companies respond

mcmanus, the spokeswoman for the florida agency for health care administration, wrote in an email.""the statewide medicaid managed care program was designed to provide comprehensive care to recipients through high quality health plans with a payment structure designed to ensure that plans paid an appropriate rate based on the health conditions of those enrolled in their plan.""

""the program currently covers more than 2 million of florida's children, offers the strongest provider network and access standards in program history, and provides families with a choice of high quality, nationally accredited plans so that they can choose the plan that best suits their needs, including specialty plans for those who qualify,"" she added.

cnn reached out to officials at all nine insurance companies. two responded.

""wellcare contributes to a variety of organizations that shape health care policy, including the florida republican party committees, the democratic party committees and those without political affiliation,"" wrote alissa lawver, a spokeswoman for wellcare. ""the company also discloses and publicly reports all political contributions on its website above and beyond the requirements of state and federal law. as a provider of managed care, wellcare is committed to partnering with the state of florida to provide access to quality, affordable health care solutions for the state's most vulnerable populations. we maintain a robust provider network and offer comprehensive care management services to create personalized, coordinated care plans to help improve and maintain the health of families and children across the state.""

she added that wellcare has accountability to florida's agency for health care administration, ""which provides careful oversight of the state's medicaid program to ensure all members, including children that transitioned from children's medical services, receive access to the right care, at the right time and in the most appropriate setting.""

ethan slavin, a spokesman for aetna, said the company makes ""donations to campaigns for both major political parties to support and address issues that impact our customers and members.""

he added that ""we are required to meet state rules and regulations regarding our network of health care providers and are consistently compliant with those requirements"" and that ""we regularly work with our members, health care providers and the state of florida to move children with special health care needs into the children's medical services program, when appropriate and in the best interest of our members. our integrated care management program regularly identifies these children and assists in this process.""

miguel ""mike"" fernandez, founder and former chairman of better health, said he had contributed several million dollars to both republicans and democrats. he added that states move medicaid patients into the care of private companies so they can ""move the risk off their financial books.""

a victory for florida families

many pediatricians use strong language to describe their anger and frustration with the florida department of health and what it did in 2015 to the 13,074 children.

""this has just been a nightmare, and we're still experiencing the fallout,"" said dr. toni richards-rowley, treasurer of the florida chapter of the american academy of pediatrics.

""it's disgusting,"" said cosgrove, the pediatrician in merritt island. ""it's all about money and not looking out for the children.""

""honestly, it makes me want to puke,"" said lida sarnecky, nurse manager of the team at the university of florida that takes care of children with cleft lip and palate.

""in my heart, what i want to do is go down to governor scott's office and ask him, 'what if this were your child or grandchild who couldn't receive the care they needed? how would you feel then?' "" she said.

by june 2015, some florida parents had had enough.

five children, including alejandro rodriguez, and yasmeen and aref shabaneh, sued the state department of health to get it to stop using the telephone questionnaire to take patients off cms, claiming that the state department of health hadn't gone through formal rulemaking procedures.

the children won.

the state didn't fight the ruling. instead, it came up with a new way to screen children for the program -- one that doesn't rely on a telephone survey and takes into consideration a child's diagnosis.

aref shabaneh lost his children's medical services coverage when his mother told the state he didn't have limitations. ""aref wants to do everything by himself,"" she said.

many parents and pediatricians assumed the state would soon reach out directly to parents to let them know they could reapply to have their children put back on cms.

they were very wrong.

five months after the judge's decision, st. petery, the tallahassee pediatric cardiologist, implored the secretary of the department of health to reach out to parents.

to st. petery, the reasoning was obvious: a judge had said that the state had violated the law. reaching out to the parents was a way of correcting wrongdoing.

the state had a notice on its website about the ability to be rescreened for cms, and at a meeting with state legislators, a department official had given out a phone number parents could call. but st. petery knew that busy parents of very sick children might not attend official state meetings or notice pages on government websites.

""i would hope that you would consider notifying each of the parents of those 13,074 children that the tool by which their child was screened out of cms has been declared invalid, and that they have the right to appeal that decision,"" st. petery wrote to dr. john armstrong, then secretary of the department of health and the state surgeon general.

armstrong wrote back that doing so would violate federal regulations, since the children had been switched to other medicaid insurance plans.

""federal regulations prohibit direct marketing to children currently being served by another managed care plan,"" he wrote back to st. petery.

cnn was unable to reach armstrong for comment. gambineri, the florida department of health spokeswoman, said he ""is no longer employed by doh.""

not satisfied with armstrong's response, st. petery sought help from us rep. kathy castor, a democrat from tampa. castor took his concerns to the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services.

on march 23, 2016, an official at that agency sent an email to justin senior, then the medicaid director at florida's agency for health care administration. cnn obtained the email under the freedom of information act.

in that email, the federal official explained to senior that federal regulations do not prohibit florida from reaching out directly to families.

""to clarify, 42 cfr 438.104 does not prohibit marketing,"" wrote jackie glaze, associate regional administrator for the division of medicaid and children's health at the centers for medicare and medicaid services, citing a federal regulation.

more than a year later, on july 24, 2017, the florida department of health sent a letter to parents letting them know that their children could be screened to get back on cms. the letter was sent to 6,081 parents whose children were removed from cms and put on another medicaid plan and were still on that plan and financially eligible for medicaid, according to gambineri, the florida health department spokeswoman.

that letter was sent nearly two years after the judge's decision. pediatricians say they're angry it took that long to directly let parents know about the possibility of getting back on cms.

gambineri said there was concern that parents might get confused.

""it was originally thought to be, and still is considered a risk, in terms of confusion and disruption to families, to send a letter because they have had rescreening available since 2015,"" gambineri said a few months before the letter was sent out.

nelson mandela and mr. rogers

now that lj stroud is back on cms, he's a happy, strapping 13-year-old who loves to play football and horse around with his brother and sisters in the family's backyard in st. augustine.

but his mother looks back on the dark days in 2015, after her son was switched off cms, when she says he would lie on the couch in pain, unable to get the surgeries he needed.

it's not just her son's physical pain that makes stroud angry; it's his emotional pain.

since lj stroud was placed back on children's medical services, he's been able to play football again.

when lj was on cms, stroud says, he received excellent care and was a contented, well-adjusted child, never thinking of himself as different despite his birth defect.

but she says that when he was in pain because he couldn't have surgery, he started to feel sorry for himself.

"" 'why did god make me this way?' "" she says he asked. "" 'why can't i be like my brothers and sisters?' ""

when she hears about how top florida officials have spoken with pride of what they did to her son and to more than 13,000 other children, she becomes livid.

last year, armstrong, then florida's surgeon general and secretary of health, made a presentation to the florida children and youth cabinet, a panel created by the state legislature to promote children's welfare.

declaring that the department of health ""cares about every child in florida,"" armstrong explained how the state removed the 13,074 children from cms.

armstrong's presentation quoted two great advocates for children, nelson mandela and fred rogers.

first, he quoted mandela: ""there can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats its children.""

and he quoted fred rogers, the star of the children's television show ""mister rogers' neighborhood"": ""anyone who does anything to help a child in life is a hero to me.""

stroud struggles for words to describe what she thinks of armstrong quoting these two champions for child welfare.

""it's just -- it's just disgusting,"" she said. ""i feel my blood boiling just thinking about it.""

but the tokyo resident found an easy way to fill the void left by her ex lover's departure.

she downloaded a romance gaming app onto her phone, and became one of the millions of women in japan to swap real life intimacy for a fantasy.

""i felt lonely,"" says saito, now 31. ""japanese men are shy and not good at flattering women. but girls want to hear 'i love you'.""

the virtual boyfriends she found in games like "" metro pd: close to you "" -- which sees a female detective discover a life-changing romance while fighting crime -- did all the things her former partner hadn't.

women in japan are finding love with virtual characters on their phones.

""when i was tired at the end of the day, before going to sleep, i was so relieved to hear his sweet and gentle words,"" she tells cnn.

saito is by no means unusual.

in a society where 44.2% of women -- almost half of japan's millennial singles aged between 18 and 34 -- are virgins, this industry has seemingly tapped into a deep desire for simulated intimacy in japan.

the birth of romance gaming

dating simulation apps first appeared in japan in the 1980s. known as ""bishoujo"" they would generally focus on a male protagonist pursuing pretty anime-style female characters.

in 1994, a team of female coders at japanese gaming company koei broke with tradition, launching the first romance game for women, ""angelique"". based on the quest of a blonde teenage girl, who is a candidate to be the next "" queen of the universe "", to choose her perfect suitor, it was wildly successful.

japanese businesswoman nanako higashi and her husband, yuzi tsutani, saw a niche in this lucrative sector. japan has the second largest mobile gaming market in the world, generating $6.5 billion of sales in 2016, according to the global games market report

so, in the mid-2000s the duo pivoted their punk gaming business, voltage , to cater to the female audience, debuting their first dating app for women ""my lover is the no.1 host"" in 2006.

""almost all women are under stress,"" says higashi. ""we wanted to provide something for them.""

that proved to be an excellent business strategy.

today, voltage is a world leader in female romance simulation apps, catering to female ""otaku"" -- intense fans of popular culture, such as anime and manga -- and other curious women.

it offers 88 romance titles, says its games have been played by 50 million (mostly female) users globally and, in the year leading up to june 2016, the company made ¥11.2 billion ($102 million), having also released english versions of some of its apps in the united states and europe.

""it doesn't matter what your type of male would be, you'll find a man that you'll really like (in these games),"" says kukhee choo, assistant professor of comparative culture at sophia university, in tokyo.

""and, of course, that male is going to be perfect.

""the perfect boyfriend.""

twelve samurai suitors

more of a ""choose your own path"" manga novel than a typical mobile phone game like candy crush, for example, (all romance apps are presented as stories, in chapters), it immerses the user in the war-torn sengoku era (1467 to 1603), where the waitress protagonist has to runaway to save her brother's life, and conveniently meets 12 potential samurai suitors along the way.

""what's unique about the female romance genre is that there are so many men in each game,"" says choo, noting that few female characters aside from the protagonist are introduced.

several times per chapter, the user must choose from a list of ""love tactics"" detailing how she could interact with these men, the goal being to achieve greater intimacy with the preferred samurai -- who normally sends mixed signals to keep the heroine keen.

""the strong and selfish men are the most popular,"" says higashi. ""the most popular characters are strong on the outside and only sometimes sweet for you.""

in japan this type of suitor is called the ""tsundere"" -- literally: ""hot-cold"" -- man. for north america audiences, voltage tweaks the formula, as it says women there want a ""macho man, both mentally and physically"".

when love makes money

broadly speaking, there are two business models for the romance apps.

the ""novel"" genre works on a fremium model, meaning they are free to download, but after reading the ""prologue"" users must pay about $4 to $5 to download the subsequent 13 or so chapters.

paying for the epilogue often brings an extra layer of romance: simulated sex scenes are a common feature.

you'll find a man that you'll really like ... and, of course, that male is going to be the perfect boyfriend kukhee choo, assistant professor of comparative culture

the ""party"" games, meanwhile, give away five or so chapters free per day, but users must pay extra to advance in the story, and to purchase add-ons such as clothes and make-up that will make them more attractive to their suitors.

there are other extras, too.

""you actually can receive an email from your love in some games,"" says higashi. ""it'll say, 'don't forget the date tomorrow night', and if you register your with name, he'll include that, too.""

sweet fantasy?

while other countries also have a romance gaming app culture -- in the united states, for example, gaming producer cheritz is a leader in the market -- the craze has taken off in japan at an unprecedented pace.

choo believes the industry's success is down to underlying social issues.

""as a society as a whole, there is a sense of alienation in the urban setting,"" she tells cnn. ""a lot of people feel they're not connected to their peers.""

a government survey released in 2015 in japan found that nearly 40% of single people in their 20s and 30s did not want a romantic partner, in real life at least.

yuirka, 26 -- who asked cnn not to use her full name -- lives in tokyo and began playing romance games when she turned 20.

she is currently single in real life.

""these romance games make me feel i want to be in love with someone,"" she tells cnn. ""the boys in these games have something lacking in the real life boys -- they are so sweet.""

does she worry spending her time living out romantic fantasies means the real thing won't live up to expectations?

""i know that it is a game,"" she says. ""a boyfriend in a romance game cannot be a substitute for a real boyfriend.""

physical transformation

choo, however, believes the fantasy being sold in romance games is shaping some girls' expectations in real life, especially in ""host clubs"" -- bars and cafes where men are employed to lavish attention on female customers.

""for the host club men, it's their job to be consumed by women,"" says choo. ""some of these female players go to host clubs and order hosts like they're playing a game. they will choose males likes characters.""

choo believes there is a ""physical transformation"" taking in place in these clubs, as men working there try to look ""closer to 2d characters"", who are typically drawn as boy band-esqe ""pretty boys"".

for now, at least, there are no official statistics to prove a direct correlation between using such games and being single, or that romance games are steering the image of japanese men.

higashi says that with more of japanese society opting for life alone, and shunning intimacy, romance gaming could be a harmless substitute.

when trump and his wife melania land in the chinese capital wednesday, they will join president xi jinping and his wife, peng liyuan, for a tour of the forbidden city , the historic palace that housed chinese emperors and their families for almost 500 years.

trump is expected to dine with xi inside the jianfu palace , although the exact location of the dinner hasn't been confirmed. the building dates back to the eighteenth century and was fully restored in 2005 , making it one of the most well-preserved parts of the palace complex.

wherever he dines in the forbidden city, trump will be the first foreign leader to have an official dinner in the palace since the founding of the people's republic in 1949.

'state visit-plus'

dining in the forbidden city will be a significant honor for trump, in keeping with what china's ambassador to the us cui tiankai promised would be a ""state visit-plus.""

""the chinese government know who they're dealing with,"" said beijing-based historian jeremiah jenne. ""it's another in a long line of fairly shrewd moves by the chinese government and something (trump is) going to be very impressed with.""

originally constructed in the early 1400s, the forbidden city is considered to be among the most important architectural and cultural monuments inside china. designed to reflect the majesty of the emperor, the vast walled complex consists of over 90 palaces and courtyards of varying significance.

the site is currently undergoing major renovations, and areas previously not accessible to the public are being opened up.

""some of those spaces are incredibly opulent and done with a much greater level of detail than the (public areas),"" jenne said. ""i'm sure he's going to be in for quite a treat.""

ming wang, a professor of government and politics at george mason university, said the chinese ""will give trump an exceptional reception, essentially they'll try to make trump happy -- that will work to china's advantage.""

during last year's election campaign, trump was a critic of china, but since becoming president -- and especially since meeting with president xi in april -- he has softened considerably, toning down his rhetoric which once called for harsher trade and economic policies towards beijing.

""(xi's) going to treat trump almost like an emperor,"" said ming.

using the forbidden city in this manner is a dramatic shift from how the palace was viewed in the early decades of the people's republic, the successor to the revolutionary government which overthrew the qing empire.

""what was once known as the 'palace of blood and tears' is now being used for a state visit,"" jenne said. ""this is an example of how the narrative (within china) has shifted, particularly in the last 25 years, it's no longer about emphasizing class revolution, in recent years it's been much greater emphasis on the glories of chinese civilization.""

trump's visit to beijing comes on the back of successful trips to tokyo and seoul, where he was lavished with praise by prime minister shinzo abe and president moon jae-in.

while both those leaders are key us allies, trump will be facing a much more formidable task in china , where he will be hoping to get support from xi for reigning in north korea's nuclear and missile programs, as well as trade issues.

ahead of leaving seoul wednesday, trump tweeted he was ""very much looking forward to meeting with president xi who is just off his great political victory,"" referring to the chinese leader's shoring up of power at the 19th communist party congress last month.

a big one. federal authorities say it's the largest irs impersonation scam they've ever seen -- swindling victims out of more than $15 million since it began in 2013.

""they have information that only the internal revenue service would know about you,"" said timothy camus, deputy inspector general for investigations with the treasury department. ""it's a byproduct of today's society. there's so much information available on individuals.""

using identity theft technology, the thieves have successfully victimized more than 3,000 people in the past two years, although the treasury department cautions that number is only documented cases and the true number might be higher. camus said they've recorded more than 366,000 reports of contact with the scammers, and it's increasing at a rate of 10,000 to 12,000 a week.

authorities believe the thieves are operating out of india, using phishing technology to make it appear they're irs agents in washington.

the federal trade commission, which goes after scammers like these from a civil standpoint, and the treasury department, which leads the criminal probe, both have open investigations.

the largest loss reported was a staggering $500,000, camus said. most have lost about $5,000.

one of those victims was former nfl player frank garcia, who is now a sports radio host in charlotte, north carolina. when he got the call, it sounded so authentic, he left the radio station in a panic, scramming to get the money they wanted.

""the only thing running through my head is, i'm going to jail. i'm gonna be on television, in handcuffs, for tax evasion,"" he recalled. ""i had to follow specific steps not to be arrested. that the authorities had been contacted and in fact, they are on the way and will be there in 30 minutes.""

garcia says he spent five hours driving to various stores around charlotte, depositing $500 each time into a paypal account set up by the woman on the phone. he ended up losing about $4,000.

he, and other victims, told cnn the swindlers never let their victims hang up the phone.

""i have never been arrested in my life and was very scared,"" said kin ko, a new jersey resident who lost about $5,000 after he says the impersonator told him he was facing five years in prison, and the irs was about to confiscate his assets: his car, his house and all the money in his bank account. the person had a badge number, read him an arrest warrant from a nearby police jurisdiction.

the thieves are incredibly smart and convincing. they harness stolen identities and use programs such as google earth to identity locations where their victims can transfer money.

""it sounded as legitimate as could be,"" said al cadenhead, a pastor in north carolina who also fell victim. ""they knew where i was. he told me where to go -- to the rite aid, up two streets turn left to the rite aid. the names of the streets, it was really just incredible.""

cadenhead told cnn he didn't come to his senses until he'd signed over $16,000.

""it was like i came out of a coma and realized this was not normal and this is not how you do business,"" he said. ""i know other people who've heard the story say 'how did a guy with a ph.d. fall victim?' i was the perfect victim. i've never been audited, never paid a traffic ticket. i don't know how to pay fines. how do i know they aren't stern and serious about everything?""

camus said many people are afraid when they hear from the irs, so they do whatever the caller says.

in december, federal authorities found and arrested two u.s.-based ""runners"" who admitted to transferring almost a million dollars from pre-paid cards to foreign bank accounts.

in many cases, victims are warned and stopped from sending more money by bank tellers or clerks at money wiring locations. ko said that it was a bank teller who told him this was a scam when the impersonator asked him to go through a second round of depositing money.

how to get help if you think you have been a victim of an irs impersonation scam, you can report it to tigta's web site or call 800-366-4484.

for frank garcia, the light came on when the woman on the phone asked him for another $8,000 after he thought his debt had been paid.

he says he decided to hang up and await what the woman promised would be an arrest -- which, of course, never came.

""i felt taken advantage of. i felt small. and i was naive,"" he said. ""i wasn't aware. i didn't understand the system. and didn't blame anybody but myself for not taking more time to understand those things.""

so far, only 1600 people of more than 5000 residential property owners in sonoma county have signed a right of entry form.

“we understand the anxiousness the frustration,” he says.

harper said the relationship between dating apps and the spread of hiv is more complicated than one might think.
dating apps and sites can play a powerful role in raising awareness about hiv and std prevention without fueling stigmas or discrimination, researchers said. THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Denver","(cnn) after uploading those carefully selected profile photos and writing a well-crafted personal bio for a dating app, you're now thinking, ""what type of person am i actually looking for?""

dating apps and sites offer the option to filter matches by sex, ethnicity, height or religion -- but they could be even more personal.

this summer, the gay social networking app grindr caught some criticism for asking in a user survey ""what is your current hiv status?"" and ""how would you feel if grindr allowed you to filter the guys you see by hiv status?""

in a statement, a grindr representative said the survey is an effort to better understand its users and to encourage discussions.

""we have observed a significant increase in user profiles openly discussing their hiv status and test dates. given that this has not been a part of our profile options to date, we are surveying users to determine both their desire to share this information, and ways to prevent stigma and provide proper support,"" the statement said. ""sometimes this involves asking uncomfortable questions.""

screenshots of the survey were posted online by daniel reeders , a ph.d. candidate who studies hiv stigma at australian national university. he got the images from a colleague, he said, and called the filter a ""digital quarantine.""

""dating sites and apps shouldn't ask for hiv status, because there's no way to guarantee that privacy and safety will be protected for people who disclose they are positive,"" reeders said. ""the harassment that 'poz' (hiv-positive) people face can be extreme, even though it's from a small segment of the community. people already have the ability to disclose their status in their profile text, if they choose to do so.""

indeed, public health and relationship experts suggest that hiv or other std filters on a dating app might do more harm than good.

more harm than good?

although an hiv filter could have the benefit of letting hiv-positive people meet others -- avoiding potentially awkward and stigmatizing conversations -- it also could have a dark side: creating a false sense of security, said dr. eric schrimshaw , associate professor of sociomedical sciences at columbia university.

some states have laws that mandate the disclosure of hiv status prior to any kind of sexual activity. but for some, a dating app filter could lead hiv-negative people to think that the filtered matches consist of only hiv-negative people, he said. from there, they might engage in unprotected sex.

this could lead to hiv infections because ""one, the potential partner might not be telling the truth in order to be able to get partners or to avoid stigma, and also the person may simply have engaged in behaviors recently that result in status change that they just don't know yet.""

another concern is that such filters could increase stigma and discrimination against people living with hiv by further isolating them socially and ""demonizing the population.""

""with more hiv stigma and discrimination, you are going to have less people who will get tested,"" said dr. gary harper , a public health professor at the university of michigan

since most stds are temporary and treatable, such as gonorrhea and chlamydia, people are more likely to seek treatment as soon as possible, harper said; they wouldn't even think to include them in their dating profiles. but a filter for any incurable std, like herpes, could increase stigma, experts said.

harper added that imposing a filter on dating app users takes away privacy rights: you may no longer have control over who can disclose information about your hiv status on an online network of strangers.

dating apps and the rise of stds

online dating sites and mobile dating applications where users can create profiles and meet with strangers, have become increasingly popular among americans. according to the pew research center , about 15% of adults in the united states are now using online or mobile matchmaking services to seek potential partners, a 36% increase from 2013.

some link the ease of seeking casual sexual partners to the spread of stds. last year, the rhode island health department attributed an increase in std cases to ""using social media to arrange casual and often anonymous sexual encounters.""

of craigslist led to a 16% increase in hiv cases across 33 states. lead author dr. a 2013 study found that the usageof craigslist led to a 16% increase in hiv cases across 33 states. lead author dr. jason chan , an assistant professor at the university of minnesota, said that although he would expect hiv cases to rise given the trend in dating app use, as people are becoming more cautious about sex, hiv might not necessarily spread.

harper said the relationship between dating apps and the spread of hiv is more complicated than one might think. the association could have more to do with a user's existing tendency to engage in risky sexual behaviors and the prevalence of hiv and other stds in one's dating pool and area.

because of the complexity of the issue, an hiv filtering feature on dating apps would not necessarily be an effective prevention measure, said dr. renata sanders , an assistant professor at johns hopkins university school of medicine.

""there is no evidence suggesting that by dividing people by their hiv status on a mobile app where people meet would work to prevent hiv,"" sanders said. ""what actually helps prevent hiv is knowing your status and using effective measures to curb hiv spread such as condoms and prep,"" a pill that can prevent the virus.

what are the alternatives?

instead of a filter, experts said, it would be better to leave the choice to users.

letting users self-report hiv and std status on their profiles could open up conversations and prevent misunderstandings that might lead to infection, and it ""helps create a norm or a culture on the app where that's a topic that gets discussed prior to meeting,"" said schrimshaw of columbia university.

some apps, in fact, are already doing that. for example, hornet , a dating app for gay men, has a ""know your status"" feature that allows users to disclose one of five hiv statuses: ""negative,"" ""negative on prep,"" ""positive,"" ""positive undetectable"" and ""unknown."" the app also allows hiv-positive users to search for other positive people, but hiv-negative users don't have the ability to look for only negative users.

dr. ian holloway , a public affairs professor at the university of california, los angeles, said hornet's positive-only search feature can be helpful for hiv-positive men to seek not only partners, but social support and advice. without giving the search to hiv-negative men, the feature could prevent users from having a false sense of security and encourage them to have conversations about hiv with their partners.

alex garner, hornet's senior health innovation strategist, said it is an effort to encourage thoughtful conversation about hiv and gay men's sexual health and to ""bridge the divide between hiv-positive and -negative people.""

dating apps and sites can play a powerful role in raising awareness about hiv and std prevention without fueling stigmas or discrimination, researchers said.

join the conversation see the latest news and share your comments with cnn health on facebook and twitter.

for example, holloway's 2013 study found that more than 80% of grindr users in southern california are willing to participate in hiv prevention programs delivered online or through mobile apps. the study suggests that apps with geolocating features may consider providing quick reference to nearby hiv testing locations as a way to encourage more men to get tested, raise awareness and help facilitate access to community services.

another recent study found that grindr was an effective way to give out hiv self-test kits to men at risk of infection and reduce the spread of hiv.

sanders, the johns hopkins professor, thinks it is good practice for apps and sites to send out alerts and information about hiv and std prevention and treatment, such as how often one should get tested for which kinds of std and what should get checked when going to see a doctor.

she has the face of a sleeping beauty -- eyes closed, the faintest and sweetest of smiles, hair carefully parted in the middle. there's an appealing and absolute serenity about her and for a fleeting moment, you think that she's a sculpture. in fact, this is a 19th century death mask, one of the most copied in history.

she's known simply as ""l'inconnue de la seine"" (the unknown woman of the seine). so the story goes, her body was retrieved from the river in paris in the 1870s or 1880s -- no one has an exact date. she'd apparently drowned herself. an attendant at the morgue was so moved by her beauty and youth (she may well have been a teenager) that he ordered a plaster mold of her face.

in the following decades, her death mask was much reproduced, in effect becoming an objet d'art. among her 20th century admirers were giacometti, man ray, vladimir nabokov and albert camus referred to her as the ""drowned mona lisa.""

""l'inconnue"" is still popular to this day although the paris river police are skeptical about her story. according to a bbc article , they think her face is too perfect, too serene for a river suicide.

memorial casts

a london artist, musician and ""jack of all trades,"" nick reynolds knows all about drowned bodies. as a young man training to be a royal navy diver, he got ""the horrible jobs"" like fishing ""grotesques"" out of the river thames. he quickly overcame his squeamishness. in middle age, he set up a niche business, "" memorial casts "" making death (and life) masks. he believes that he's the only specialist of his kind in britain, working out of a modest flat in archway, in north london.

as nick reynolds will tell you, death masks began in antiquity -- the most famous being the funerary mask of tutankhamun. wealthy romans ritually kept death masks of their ancestors for display and worship. the victorians too were briefly obsessed -- according to the victorian science of phrenology, you could determine a person's character and personality from the shape of his head. from the 1820s to the 1840s, a leading british phrenologist and mask-maker, james de ville, accumulated some 2,000 specimens.

german born pianist and composer ludwig van beethoven was another famous face to be cast after his death. credit: courtesy imagno / contributor

edinburgh university's anatomy museum, scotland yard's crime museum and america's princeton university have all been left large collections of death masks. so, we can deduce from their collections that beethoven could evidently look a bit grumpy, and that at the end of their lives, the duke of wellington didn't have many teeth and benjamin disraeli had bags under his eyes. the victorians were transfixed by gruesome murder stories so there's an extensive legacy of executed villainy -- death masks of the edinburgh murderer and body snatcher, william burke (of ""burke and hare"") and the australian outlaw, ned kelly.

some death masks have become highly collectible. one of napoleon -- taken shortly after he died in exile on st helena in 1821 -- sold at bonham's in london in 2013 for £170,000 (approximately $220,000). the death mask of a notorious victorian murderer, benjamin courvoisier, hanged in 1840 (and witnessed by a crowd of 40,000 including charles dickens), was recently found in an outbuilding on a remote farm in cumbria in the north of england. it fetched £20,000 ($26,000) at auction earlier this year.

the bronze death mask of explorer napoleon bonaparte was sold for a staggering £175,000 ($24,000) in 2013. credit: courtesy heritage images / contributor

nick reynold's personal fascination with death masks began when he was just eight or nine when he saw the death mask of the 17th century english political and military leader, oliver cromwell. ""that's a man frozen in time,"" reynolds remembers, ""you could see the warts, one on his forehead, one under his bottom lip.""

reynolds gets extremely animated talking about his profession. he feels he is capturing ""a sublime moment between life and death, a snapshot of the soul."" but he's also aware that he's out of step with the times. ""everyone wants to stay young, everyone is airbrushed,"" he says. ""people are haunted by the idea of old age, let alone death. the victorians embraced death, celebrated the majesty of it.""

the artist behind one of the world's most famous painting, the kiss, gustav klimt also had his death mask made shortly after his passing. credit: courtesy imagno / contributor

he's not good on figures (or dates for that matter) but thinks he's done 60 to 100 death masks, including film director ken russell and the former editor of the times newspaper, william rees-mogg. he's also made up to 200 life masks. his living ""sitters"" include singer grace jones, mick jones of the clash and astronaut buzz aldrin.

the son of a convicted british criminal (bruce reynolds, the mastermind behind the so called ""great train robbery"" in 1963), reynolds started out doing life masks of his father and his aging criminal friends. the resulting show in 1999 was succinctly entitled ""cons to icons.""

reynolds certainly tells a good yarn and 2013 was a particularly eventful year. his father died and so he naturally made his death mask. the bronze cast sits atop the dresser in his flat and he cheerfully admits to talking to him. his godfather, another ""great train robber,"" ronnie biggs, also died that year.

while at the north london undertakers for biggs, reynolds was told that another celebrity had just checked in. the actor peter o'toole occupied the next drawer to biggs in the refrigerated metal cabinet. after making a phone call, reynolds made death masks of both men. in life, o' toole had been consulted by his daughter about having a death mask and had apparently conferred his blessing. according to reynolds, he allegedly said "" i don't care. i'll be dead.""

a new wave of death masks

in boston, mit professor neri oxman is a pioneer in ultra-high definition 3d printing. she and her research group were commissioned by 3d printing company stratasys to digitally design a series (with no human model) of death masks for the company's ""new ancient"" collection. the results have been recently exhibited at london's design museum and paris's centre pompidou and are simply extraordinary.

can you create a death or life mask without actually using a human face? according to neri oxman the artist behind this piece, yes you can, with the help of 3-d printing. credit: courtesy neri oxman/ stratasys

the masks are mesmerizingly beautiful and translucent, filled with smoky whirls of color -- reds, oranges, greens and purples. they seem to evoke many things. there's a hint of human skull, of sea crustacean, intricately designed jewelery. and you half expect them to burst into life like some alien creature in a ridley scott movie.

professor oxman is clearly experimenting: ""each mask represents an imaginary martyr going through a metamorphosis from life to death or death to life,"" she says. the vaporous internal patterns are evidently meant to suggest each martyr's living or dying breath. oxman describes the masks as ""speculative design objects"" rather than art. one of her central interests is synthetic biology. the claim is that the masks were 3d printed at a level of resolution and complexity usually only found in nature.

'the skin came out in goosebumps'

reynolds still goes about his work in the traditional way -- without recourse to computers or algorithms. ""it's quite a messy business,"" he says. a key part of the process, along with plaster of paris and wax, is a molding compound, alginate gel -- the same material that dentists use to make impressions of teeth. in the case of death masks, all but one of his subjects were already embalmed.

the one exception was john joe ""ash"" amador, a 30-year-old american executed for murder in texas in 2007. reynolds got involved as part of protest against the death penalty in the us. he remembers it vividly. he'd talked to amador by phone just ten minutes or so before his execution. amador told him, ""having a death mask made was a real honor because it was normally reserved for kings and people like that. now i am somebody.""

artist nick reynolds said that when he cast him, amador's body was ""still warm"" and ""the skin came out in goose bumps"" as the mould was applied. credit: courtesy nick reynolds

reynolds made the death mask some 15 minutes after the execution, in a cabin in the woods near the prison. amador's body was ""still warm"" and ""the skin came out in goose bumps"" as the mold was applied. reynolds made a cast of amador's head as well as the arm where he'd been given the lethal injection. seven years later, the death mask was featured in a show, ""disobedient objects,"" at london's victoria & albert museum in 2014.

reynolds thinks that there's something ""magical and mystical"" about death masks; they're a way of ""cocking a snook at death,"" he says.

at the end of our chat, i almost forget to ask the most obvious question. at 54, was nick reynolds thinking about having a death mask made of himself?

""ha!"" came the swift reply. ""already had myself done life-size, full body as jesus, holding open the wound on my side, which is actually a vagina."" THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for San Antonio",the curious art of death masks

(cnn) tl;dr version : you can vote on the first story i'll report as part of this new series on 2 degrees celsius -- which is the agreed-upon threshold for dangerous climate change. go here if you don't see the poll . thanks!

* * * * *

in 2013, i did something that's a little scary for a journalist.

i asked you to tell me what to cover.

those experiences have strengthened my belief in the power of democratic journalism. editors shouldn't get all the control. you, the audience, have a vital say, too.

still, in the two years since i asked for your ideas, i haven't done much, if anything, to address one of the topics you most frequently asked me to cover : climate change.

i'm hoping to make good on your request now.

starting today, earth day, i'm planning to spend the rest of the year writing about one tiny little number -- 2 degrees. it may be the most important number you've never heard of.

maybe that plan sounds excessive.

(eight months reporting on one number!?)

but here's why it matters: if we humans warm the world more than 2 degrees celsius (3.6 fahrenheit), we greatly up the odds of climate catastrophes.

think super droughts, rising seas, mass extinctions and acidifying oceans.

we don't want to cross that mark.

humans never have lived in post-2-degree world, said carlo jaeger, chair of the global climate forum, based in germany, and author of a paper on this history of 2 degrees.

""if we start warming the planet way beyond what humans have ever experienced, god knows what will wait for us,"" he told me.

good news, though. if we drastically cut carbon emissions, we can stay below the 2-degree threshold. as part of this series, i'll be exploring exactly what it would take to do so.

this matters a great deal this year, since the united nations will gather leaders and policy experts in paris in december to try to hammer out a new international agreement on climate change. two degrees will be one useful benchmark to see if the world is on track.

""it's almost kind of like a truth keeping mechanism,"" said jennifer morgan, global director of the climate change program at the world resources institute. ""it would be hard if it didn't exist to have a sense of whether countries are on track or not.""

it's not a perfect yardstick. but it's a reasonable one. think of it like a speed limit, said jaeger, the economist in germany. would a 51 mph limit be better than 50? or maybe it should be 49? the point isn't the exact number, it's the ballpark: 200 mph would certainly be too fast, as he put it, but 20 mph is too slow.

for climate change, the point is we don't know the world will fall into crisis at exactly 2 degrees and not 2.1 or 1.8. but that range is certainly dangerous.

""the way i think of it is like smoking,"" said katharine hayhoe, an atmospheric scientist and director of the climate science center at texas tech. ""how many cigarettes are too many? i don't know. i have no idea. nobody has any idea. but we do know the more cigarettes you smoke, the greater the risk.""

two degrees, then, is our most educated estimate. a way to focus attention.

it's incredibly valuable in that respect.

since the number emerged from a relatively obscure academic paper in the 1970s, it's become widely agreed upon in the international community. in 2009, for example, 114 countries initially signed onto the ""copenhagen accord,"" a nonbinding agreement that recognizes the ""scientific view that the increase in global temperature should be below 2 degrees celsius.""

that level of consensus is rare on this topic.

""if there's one thing the world has agreed upon about climate change it's 2 degrees should be the benchmark,"" said jamie henn, co-founder of 350.org , an advocacy group.

i'll be writing more about the origins of 2 degrees soon -- where this number came from (one guy, turns out, and i chatted with him), how soon we may cross that mark if we don't take action (short answer: 2050), and how much we've warmed the planet since the start of the industrial revolution, in the late 1800s, which is how these temperature increases are usually measured (0.85 degrees).

right now, though, i'd like to ask you to do something that's scary and exciting.

i want you to vote on the first project i'll report for this series.

all of the options center on one theme: what does a post-2-degree world look like?

i love that question because it -- like all six choices you'll see below -- came from you.

cnn hosted a facebook chat on friday , asking our audience to come up with questions for me about climate change or about 2 degrees of warming. many of you said you wanted to know what a 2-degree world would have in store, in general. other folks asked about specific impacts to people and ecosystems if the climate continues to inch toward that dangerous 2-degree mark.

clay miller, from alaska, for example, asked about the arctic.

cindy johnson wanted to know which animals would go extinct first.

jon locke was among those curious about farms.

and many of you, including kayla helton, from florida, asked about rising seas. kelly, a 48-year-old from california, wanted to know what would happen to ""climate refugees"" as the coast vanishes.

tell cnn's john sutter which of these climate change stories you like best - and he'll report on the winner. this poll closes monday, april 27, at 5pm et. #2degrees posted by cnn on tuesday, april 21, 2015

the topic with the most votes on monday at 5 p.m. et is the one i'll report in may.

after meeting a girl in a local punk band, le mindu was introduced to an assortment of new music and attitudes, and at 17, he and his friend moved to berlin. it was here that he began making money from his hairdressing.

for a start, world leaders should convene a top-level emergency gathering to focus on the key aspects of this crisis. the conference should be called by a group of countries, including germany with strong backing from the united states, and should include the european union, the united nations and other world powers, syria's neighbors, and also russia and china. the objective should be threefold: to stop the killing, to help the refugees and to bring an end to the war.

arab nations must play a major role in addressing the syrian crisis. we are all responsible. but the people of syria are their neighbors, their brethren. the conflict is in their midst, its impact close to home. to be sure, the neighborhood has not completely failed syrian refugees. the overwhelming majority of those who have fled syria -- millions of them -- are now living in turkey, jordan and lebanon, and arab states have helped finance those costs. but more is needed.

once convened, this international conference should work to develop a comprehensive international plan to help refugees, one that involves a much greater role for arab and other muslim states. indeed, wealthy gulf states should be encouraged to not just make an outsize financial contribution, but countries like the united arab emirates, kuwait, oman and saudi arabia should be pressed to welcome refugees.

of course, europe and the united states should also receive more from among the millions of desperate syrian refugees fleeing conflict. but so should thriving muslim states such as malaysia, indonesia and of course iran, whose support for syrian president bashar al-assad means it has additional moral responsibility for what is happening. (and speaking of asia, this could be an opportunity for a country like japan, with its demographic crisis, to boost its population, or at least do its part to share the burden of this major humanitarian emergency.)

but giving refuge to those who are fleeing the horrors of conflict is not enough -- the crisis also needs to be tackled at its source. so, to at least try to slow the killing, it is time to give serious consideration to the establishment of safe zones inside syria, a proposal that is actually more complicated than it might sound.

for example, when turkey proposed such an approach , some feared that it secretly planned to expel syrian refugees from turkish territory and send them back inside syria to any safe zones. if the system is to work, these zones must come with an ironclad vow from countries hosting refugees not to force anyone to return to syria before the war is over.

safe zones will, of course, require a military commitment to be effective, perhaps from the united states, nato and other allies, to guarantee the ""safe"" in ""safe zones."" they will therefore need to become no-fly zones, with air patrols and anti-aircraft support on the ground. the betrayal of so-called safe areas in bosnia's srebrenica must never be allowed to happen again.

above all, though, it is imperative to bring an end to the war, to defeat isis and -- just as crucially, although this point now often gets overlooked -- to bring an end to the regime of al-assad, whose rejection of peaceful demands for democratic reform laid the groundwork for this epic human displacement and for the upsurge in extremism.

such an enormous movement of people is further destabilizing an already unsettled region, and bringing with it a level of disruption that could very well sow the seeds for another generation of conflict and extremism.

the west's initial approach, which effectively viewed the syrian civil war as ""their problem,"" has merely underscored how in reality there is no way to contain such conflicts within national boundaries -- this war has spawned isis, its videotaped beheadings and sanctioned sexual slavery , scattering its poisonous extremist ideology far and wide. and while an international gathering cannot undo the devastation that has been wrought, it can still be a positive first step toward winding down this conflict.

this is the moral and strategic challenge of our time. so far, the world has failed. but if its leaders can begin to publicly and materially empower those who stand for a pluralistic, tolerant and democratic syria -- one that will eventually welcome back the millions of citizens who have fled -- then we might be able to turn the compassion we have seen in recent days into a more hopeful legacy for the country and its people.

allison schmitt is the co-captain of the usa olympic swimming team at the 2016 rio games. THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for San Antonio","(cnn) imagine that swimming is what you've loved for more than 15 years, but whenever you dive into the pool, you feel like a disappointment, unmotivated to go forward. the feeling is almost destructive. that was what was going on in allison schmitt 's mind during training after the 2012 london olympic games.

it hasn't always been that way.

to schmitt, swimming is a lifestyle, not a responsibility. even when she felt stressed, she wouldn't see swimming as a burden. instead, she looked at it as something fun.

""it's what keeps me going,"" she said.

in and out of the pool, schmitt keeps a positive attitude. she prefers to be a happy person, not the downer. ""laugh it off"" is her go-to coping mechanism.

jack bauerle, schmitt's coach at the university of georgia until 2013, has known her since 2005. he calls her a giver. ""sometimes, she puts her feelings in the back burner so that she could help others,"" bauerle said.

road to the olympics

a swimming career that would net eight olympic medals started when schmitt was 9. as ""the kid that wanted to [play] every sport,"" schmitt was a soccer player but didn't end up making the team. she decided to devote her athletic spirit and talents to the pool.

in fact, schmitt didn't quite like swimming at first; she was just following her older sister, kirsten. her fondness for swimming grew as she made friends on the team, and those relationships became an increasingly important part of her life.

growing up swimming, schmitt has always been disciplined. no matter how busy the training, she made sure that she finished schoolwork and didn't miss classes.

it was a surprise when she found out that she made the olympic team for the 2008 beijing games. she thought she wouldn't be qualified because she was the ""slow kid."" she didn't feel like she belonged on the team and even had a ""breakdown"" during the training camp.

winning a bronze medal in the 4x200-meter freestyle relay and almost making it to the 200-meter freestyle final during the games gave her confidence.

between 2008 and 2012, she trained as hard as she could while studying psychology at the university of georgia. before the london games, she took a year off from school to concentrate on preparing for the game.

her effort paid off: she hauled in three golds in the 2012 games.

the shadows of depression

the london olympics marked a high point in schmitt's swimming career. after that, depression crept in.

she became cranky and got irritated at minor problems. she remembered getting mad at not having the sports drink that she liked on the day of training and thinking, ""this is the worst day ever.""

she began to sleep more and more. when she entered the water, she didn't feel motivated, instead thinking she was a disappointment.

schmitt didn't want others to notice. all she wanted was for her team to achieve its goal and to do what she could as a good teammate.

""allison is the last person you would think that will get depressed,"" said bob bowman, schmitt's coach since 2006. ""she just has a bubbly, happy and smiling personality.""

he knew something was off when he got calls from a crying, upset schmitt after the london games.

her performance in the pool also tipped her off. ""the spirit wasn't there,"" said bauerle, schmitt's georgia swimming coach. ""you could just see the difference sometimes.""

bauerle thought it was just a passing phase, ""post-olympic blues."" but for schmitt, this ""phase"" lasted a little too long.

she had kept her struggles from friends and family. the hidden pains, however, didn't fool fellow olympic swimmer michael phelps, her surrogate brother.

in january 2015, schmitt was at what she calls the breaking point. she would dive into the water, thinking, ""oh, my gosh, i can't do this anymore."" she became angrier and more isolated. then phelps reached out, telling schmitt that he would be there to help if she needed anything. coaches and teammates also came to her aid.

seeing phelps go through his own mental health struggles, schmitt thought, if he said she would be able to push through, she could do the same. so she took his advice to seek help and started to see a psychologist that january.

""i started accepted the fact that i wanted to get help,"" said schmitt. ""it's ok to feel that way.""

bringing the darkness of depression to light

according to the national institute of mental health , depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the united states. in 2014, it is estimated that at least 6.7% of us adults had at least one depressive episode.

scott goldman , a sports psychologist at the university of michigan, said it is normal for some athletes to experience a sense of loss after the olympics.

""you give everything you have to something. when that something ends, it's significant,"" he said. ""for a lot of them, this is a roller coaster of excitement. ... it's a difficult transition from 'i am a swimmer' to 'i was a swimmer.' ""

to some, post-olympic blues can be just as hard to cope with as the death of a loved one or the end of a relationship, said goldman.

for a while, schmitt wasn't open about her psychological suffering. she thought that seeing a psychologist was an embarrassment and kept it from her family. it wasn't until her cousin, a young athlete named april bocian, ended her own life in may 2015 that schmitt decided to speak out.

""especially as athletes, we are taught that if we push through something, we can get through. we use that mentality in sports, and we use that in life,"" said schmitt. ""but life is such a big game. you need a whole army of support and help that you can get.""

by being outspoken about her own struggles, she hopes she'll inspire more people to recognize the severity of depression and the importance of seeking help.

now, schmitt has become more comfortable sharing her thoughts and emotions with the psychologist. she goes to her office whenever she needs someone to talk to. she's also considering pursuing a master's degree in social work to counsel those who are struggling with mental health problems.

allison schmitt is the co-captain of the usa olympic swimming team at the 2016 rio games. she won gold in the 4x200m freestyle relay final.

the changes are obvious. bowman and bauerle said they saw a much happier and more positive schmitt during the rio games, where she took home a gold medal and a silver.

bauerle thinks schmitt opening up about depression would be helpful to those who are going through similar struggles, especially athletes and their coaches.

""going back in time, i wish i had a better hold on her,"" said bauerle. ""she's giving service for coaches, to make sure that they are more aware. ... i think everybody's radar will be a little better for athletes.""

goldman, the sports psychologist, suggested that people close to athletes recognize post-performance phases as a natural part of the process, be mindful of the warning signs, and offer true and honest support.

unlike physical injuries, which can be seen in bandages, athletes' psychological struggles could often go unnoticed. goldman said that depending on the kind of sports, ""they might move at a slower pace; they might have trouble getting out of bed; they might have trouble getting engaged in tasks they did well before.""

certain leaders, who claim to be religious, are dedicated to a greedy notion of jesus who just wants one thing for his loyal followers: money, money and more money.

my interest in this exploitation of jesus deepened after i met costi hinn. his uncle, pastor benny hinn, claims god uses him as a conduit to cure disease: he simply ""lays hands,"" jesus-like, on a chronically ill person, pushes them to the ground and -- bam! -- the person bounces back to health.

pastor hinn also preaches the ""prosperity gospel,"" a belief system that teaches followers that they can acquire wealth if they are devout christians who give money, and lots of it, to his ministry.

in a 2016 youtube video , titled ""your financial miracle is at the door,"" pastor hinn told viewers, ""i'm talking to you that are facing a financial challenge. that money is already there for you. ... abundance will come to you in the name of jesus, the son of almighty god. you're going to stop living from paycheck to paycheck. but first you're going to sow a seed. for those who want abundance, $1,000. for those that want a new season, $120.""

and people empty their pockets. hinn is worth tens of millions of dollars. ""you put a guy on a platform in a real nice suit, in a beautiful auditorium,"" costi told me, ""you say god is like your magic genie; if you rub him right and do all the right things, your bank account's going to grow.""

costi hinn on mission in santa tecla, el salvador

according to the dallas morning news, pastor hinn's ministry is currently under investigation by the irs. pastor hinn is unfazed. his organization posted on facebook , ""the ministry has undergone intense scrutiny over the years, and we remain confident that there will again be a positive and speedy outcome in the days ahead.""

hln reached out to hinn's ministry to talk about this matter further, but we got no response. to date, pastor hinn, who has been preaching the prosperity gospel for some time now, has not been charged with any crime.

that devil-may-care-attitude is consistent with that of a mafia don -- sans the killing of course. i use that descriptor because it's how costi described the hinn family empire.

""it has the lavishness of the royal family and the strict enforcement of a mafia type of family,"" he told me. ""you keep to your own. you defend your own. you never ever, regardless of what the truth might be, do anything to harm or expose the family.""

yet costi did just that. he questioned uncle benny's faith, publicly exposed the hypocrisy of the prosperity gospel. and, just like that, costi says he was shunned by his family, excommunicated from all things hinn. costi told me he has yet to hear from his uncle and, as far as i can tell, pastor hinn has not publicly commented on his nephew's decision.

but that is fine with costi.

""i was greedy,"" he told me. ""we were exploiting the poor, using our greed, squeezing every last dollar out of people so we could live the way they never could.""

and, he added, ""we were using jesus to do that.""

of course, uncle benny would argue jesus would desire a lavish life for all, complete with private jets, palatial mansions and fancy cars. it's how, according to costi, pastor hinn lives, along with his round-the-clock security and armored vehicles.

this prosperity gospel, with its distorted image of jesus, makes me angry, but more than that, it makes me sad.

organized religion can be wonderful. my catholic faith centers me; it makes me want to be a kind, generous, loving person -- a person rich in spirit, not in material wealth.

and costi gives me hope that more people will open their eyes and see a more loving god. after all, he sacrificed his family to embrace the authentic jesus.

(cnn) on wednesday night, the country music community will come together for the 51st annual cma awards in nashville. i'll be there for the third time, and for me, this night reflects everything i love about country music: artists and performers from all walks of life and genres, coming together to share their truth through their music.

i don't think i'll ever forget the electricity created when justin timberlake joined chris stapleton at the 2015 cmas.

this year promises more of the same with what could be a show-stealing collaboration between niall horan and maren morris.

now, more than at any other time in recent memory, the country music is demonstrating its strength through its diversity. the genre is showcasing its ability to bring different worlds together and heal some of the great divides that stem from our toxic political climate, both in the wake of the las vegas tragedy and beyond.

that's why it was so troubling when, last night, reports surfaced that the country music association had released media guidelines directing reporters to ""refrain from focusing your coverage of the cma awards red carpet and backstage media center on the las vegas tragedy, gun rights, political affiliations or topics of the like."" failure to do so would result in having your media credential ""reviewed and potentially revoked via security escort.""

the guidelines were met with immediate backlash, led by cma awards co-host brad paisley, who tweeted , ""i'm sure the cma will do the right thing and rescind these ridiculous and unfair press guidelines. in 3...2...1...""

brad was right.

if anything, this situation at the very least provides a teachable moment. the hasty attempt to control the conversation only ignited focus and attention on the very topics they were trying to avoid being fixated on by the media.

as a long-time media and communications professional, i understand that impulse to want to try and control every facet of the conversation surrounding your event. however, hiding from uncomfortable topics and issues is not a solution. particularly when you're talking about a format that uses music and lyrics so effectively to address social issues.

here are a few examples:

donna's death on ""kevin can wait""

james is currently starring in the cbs sitcom ""kevin can wait,"" which recently killed off his character's wife, played by erinn hayes.

now, killing off a character is not out of the ordinary, but the show managed to make this particular plot twist especially awkward.

some ""kevin can wait"" viewers complained that series treated the character's death too lightly, making a joke about her gym sending a postcard saying she was missed.

original vs. new becky on ""roseanne""

fans still like to argue over who was the better becky on the hit 1990s sitcom ""roseanne.""

actress lecy goranson played the eldest conner child for the first five seasons, before leaving to go to college.

sarah chalke was then recast in the role for season 6, which some viewers didn't love.

goranson tried to work with the show -- reprising her role in season 8 -- but ultimately chalke became becky full time.

the whole thing turned into a running gag on ""rosanne,"" which would sometimes include jokes about the missing goranson.

the forthcoming ""roseanne"" revival is set to have goranson back as becky and chalke in another role.

what happened to judy on ""family matters?""

judy winslow went upstairs to her room one day and was never seen or heard from again.

at least that's how fans of abc's ""family matters"" felt like it all went down.

the sitcom, which ran from 1989 to 1997, made the character steve urkle famous. but it was the disappearance of young judy after four seasons that many viewers still talk about.

THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for San Diego","(cnn) from a nutritional standpoint, there's much to love about panera bread's offerings. in fact, when it comes to healthy meals to grab on the go, we think that panera trumps all other fast food fare.

whether you wish to select portion-controlled items from their ""you pick two"" menu or you appreciate the chain's commitment to clean ingredients (all meals will be free of artificial preservatives, sweeteners, colors and flavors by the end of 2016, the company claims), you really can't go too far astray at this health-conscious eatery.

but one cautionary note about beverages: unless you're burning lots of energy and can afford some extra carbs (perhaps training for a half-marathon), it's best to pair your meals with water, tea or other unsweetened drinks, as many beverages at fast food chains contain well over a day's worth of added sugars.

here are the best panera bread options if you're focused on healthy choices within the limits of the menu (which can change, even seasonally, and sometimes titles of dishes). we break it down by good choices for kids, athletes, drivers, vegetarians and vegans, as well as low-calorie, low-sugar, low-salt, gluten-free and low-carb options.

for kids

our picks: kids' all-natural turkey chili with kids' classic salad and squeezable yogurt

one of the healthiest options on panera's kids menu is the kids' all-natural turkey chili , which contains 8 grams of fiber and 11 grams of protein, available in cooler seasons.

pair it with a salad to encourage some brave green bites, and don't forget about the squeezable yogurt , a fun treat that adds a calcium boost to the meal.

other good options for kids include the low-fat vegetarian black bean soup and the low-fat all-natural chicken noodle soup. the sandwiches are higher in saturated fat, and all include nutritionally inferior white bread. and while the kids' mac & cheese with white cheddar is delish, save it for the weekend splurge, as it contributes a generous amount of cholesterol-raising saturated fat.

for vegetarians

our pick: tomato mozzarella flatbread and classic salad

if cheese is your protein go-to on a vegetarian diet, then panera's tomato mozzarella flatbread should be at the top of your list. this flatbread satisfies with fresh mozzarella and tomatoes and basil pesto sauce, and it has only 460 milligrams of sodium. add the seasonal salad to boost the protein and double the fiber content of the meal.

note: the seasonal lentil quinoa bowl offers a hearty combination of protein-rich ingredients, including a nutrient-rich egg (if you haven't heard, eggs -- including the yolk -- get the green light these days). the only downside of the lentil bowl: it will give you half of your sodium quota for the day.

for vegans

our picks: modern greek salad with quinoa but without feta

it can be challenging to find nutrient-rich vegan options that please the palate, but this salad offers a tasty combo of kale, romaine, kalamata olives and heart-healthy almonds -- all tossed with greek dressing.

if you're craving variety, you could get a half portion of the salad with a cup of the low-fat vegetarian garden vegetable soup, without pesto, or black bean soup as part of the ""you pick two"" menu, but it would drive sodium levels up for the meal.

for calorie-counters

our picks: seasonal salad with chicken (half) and low-fat vegetarian garden vegetable soup with pesto (1 cup)

sometimes we wonder if the ""p"" in panera stands for portion control. the ""you pick two"" menu is a dieter's delight, as it controls calories without you having to think. the specific combination of non-creamy soup and salad, both high-volume foods, goes a long way toward keeping you full on fewer calories, according to research. note: if you can afford a few more calories, go for the low-fat vegetarian black bean soup, which will add even more protein and fiber to the meal, keeping you satiated long after you've had your last bites.

for the sugar-sensitive

our picks: roasted turkey and avocado blt on sourdough (half) and caesar salad (half)

it might sound strange recommending the roasted turkey and avocado blt over the roasted turkey and caramelized kale panini ; after all, ""superfood"" kale is typically considered healthier than sodium-laden bacon. the turkey sandwich has slightly less saturated fat and sodium, and a bit more protein, but the entire meal has only 2 grams of sugar. that's just half a teaspoon's worth.

for the salt-sensitive

our picks: classic salad with chicken and an apple

at 320 milligrams for the whole salad, the classic salad with chicken is one of the lowest-sodium items on panera's entire menu. adding an apple gives a potassium boost, which helps to lessen sodium's effects on blood pressure.

since it's rare to find tomato foods that are lower in sodium, the tomato mozzarella flatbread, which has 460 milligrams of sodium, is also worth mentioning.

for the gluten-sensitive

our picks: fuji apple chicken salad

with all of panera's fresh-baked bread, it can't guarantee that its menu items have not touched gluten. so while its gluten-conscious menu items are made without gluten-containing ingredients, if you have celiac disease, heightened gluten sensitivity or a wheat allergy, your best bet may be to avoid the chain.

that being said, panera offers plenty of options if you're simply looking to avoid or cut back on gluten. on its list of gluten-free fare is the tasty fuji apple chicken salad . with its crunchy apple chips, gorgonzola cheese and pecans, it's one of our favorites on panera's entire menu.

for the athlete

our picks: steak and arugula sandwich (half) and a superfruit power smoothie

with a healthy combination of performance-boosting nutrients including iron, protein and carbs, we can't think of a better pre- or post-workout meal combination than this sandwich and smoothie . (if your appetite won't be satisfied with a half sandwich, go for the whole one.) the greek yogurt in the smoothie provides electrolytes that are lost in sweat, including calcium, potassium and magnesium, and boosts the protein content of the meal, which is key for muscle rebuilding post-workout.

for the road warrior

our picks: tuna salad sandwich on honey wheat with apple and baked crisps

this no-fuss tuna sandwich is satisfying and easy to eat on the road. don't forget the apple and chips, especially on long trips.

for the carb-conscious

our pick: romaine and kale caesar salad with chicken (half)

with only 5 grams of carbs and 21 grams of protein, this power salad is sure to satisfy all of the carb counters we know. we especially love the parmesan crisps, which are a tasty substitute for carb-rich croutons. (the crisps also contribute a generous dose of calcium to the salad). just keep saturated fat in check during the rest of the day, as it runs on the higher side.

for the breakfast lover

our pick: power almond quinoa oatmeal

""it means that she's paying attention to what's going on,"" says towers, who specializes in high-risk pregnancies at the university of tennessee medical center.

jessica admits to making many mistakes, but here, she is making what she says is the best choice of her life: getting clean for her baby. she also has an 8-year-old son who has been raised by her mom. she hopes detoxing will further heal their relationship.

a tattoo above her heart reads ""from pain comes strength.""

she wishes she could lean over her belly, put her lips by her daughter's head and whisper to her about life lessons. ""i'm working on building our relationship and trying so hard. i mainly want her to know that i won't make those choices any more.""

jessica marvels at the screen. ""is that her little face?""

""yeah, that's a cheek,"" towers says.

""she's got chubby cheeks,"" jessica replies.

jessica hill, 28, was hooked on opioids and wanted to get clean, but she was told that detoxing would kill her fetus.

when jessica first came to towers four months ago, she was taking a standard opioid-based maintenance medication, called subutex, meant to keep her from getting her fix from the street. she had been told at a drug maintenance clinic that detoxing would kill her fetus.

when she went to a doctor who she hoped could deliver her child, jessica was humiliated. she had informed the doctor she was taking subutex to tamp down her urge for painkillers. the doctor, she says, told her they don't ""take irresponsible patients.""

""i was just so upset, because they just shunned us away,"" she says.

the maintenance clinic then referred her to the university of tennessee medical center. jessica first visited a doctor at the hospital's prenatal clinic in december and was introduced to emily katz, the substance abuse coordinator in towers' office. katz saw a young woman who needed help -- but, more important, wanted help.

""we snatched her up,"" she says. ""there was just a spark in her. when i told jessica, 'i think we can help you,' tears just streamed down her face.""

it's now mid-march. towers has weaned jessica off the medication slowly, with jessica making the hour-long trip from her home in morristown to his office every two weeks, almost always accompanied by her best friend, stephanie moore. today, stephanie chimes in with cheerful jokes about the baby's stubbornness, similar to her mother's.

in between visits, jessica texts and phones katz, who was motivated to help others after her brother died of an overdose. the two have become so close over the months that both say they're like twins separated at birth. jessica has nicknamed katz ""nurse barbie"" for her attractiveness and her straight blonde hair.

on this day, katz quietly observes during the ultrasound, making her show of support by just being there.

jessica went completely off the opioids over the past week, a critical juncture during any detoxification. she suffered through diarrhea and other ailments. only once did she give into her urge, taking one subutex pill. ""it sucks,"" she says.

in those down moments, stephanie and katz remind her why she's going through this: that the struggle is worth the pain.

but even with all that jessica has endured, there's no guarantee her baby will be free of the violent tremors and excruciating pain that marks those born to addicted mothers. about one in five women who detox in towers' program still sees her baby suffer withdrawal after birth, depending on how early in pregnancy the mothers were able to become drug-free and how their bodies metabolize the opioids still in their systems.

dr. craig towers has helped more than 500 women detox during pregnancy: ""it's the right thing to do.""

towers assures jessica that her baby will be safe if she continues to not use. with the due date a month away, he says he wants to begin seeing her twice a week to make sure she stays on track.

her pregnancy was not planned, and jessica worries that child services could take her daughter away because of her history of drug abuse.

""the only way they would take her from you is if you were using something off the street or if there's something in your drug screen that wasn't prescribed to you,"" towers says. ""that's why i just want to see you a lot, make sure you're doing ok, and if there's any issues, we prevent a relapse.""

the next few weeks will prove critical. jessica will lean on this supportive cast: the doctor, her best friend and ""nurse barbie.""

towers knows all too well what's at stake. three days earlier, an expectant woman who he hoped would enroll in his program was found dead of an overdose, the first such death this year in knox county.

concerns over relapse risk

every 25 minutes in america, a baby is born in withdrawal from opioids . they shake violently, vomit constantly and scream incessantly. upon arrival in this world, one of the first things the newborns are given is an opioid to lessen the intensity of their shakes.

delivery rooms have become overwhelmed, especially along the appalachia corridor stretching from ohio and west virginia into kentucky and down to this northeast corner of tennessee. the average hospital stay for a baby suffering withdrawal lasts about 17 days, costing more than $66,000 per child, according to the us centers for disease control and prevention.

tennessee alone experienced a 15-fold increase in babies going through withdrawal from 2002 to 2012. and the numbers have continued to rise.

how to treat these babies has become a matter of urgency among doctors, clinicians, researchers and social workers. are we failing these newborns? what are we not doing that we should? can more be done on the front end to prevent the shaking and vomiting?

the university of tennessee medical center sits amid the heart of america's opioid epidemic.

almost everyone agrees that the nation must tackle this issue with a comprehensive approach. but the opinions on what to do vary. long-standing guidance from the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists on detoxification during pregnancy has been this: ""withdrawal from opioid use during pregnancy is associated with poor neonatal outcomes, including early preterm births or fetal demise, and with higher relapse rates among women.""

at a summit on prescription drug and heroin abuse in atlanta in april, participants from across the country discussed the increasing number of babies going through withdrawal and how to best care for them and their mothers. experts stressed the need for better treatment programs for pregnant women, especially in rural america.

detoxification during pregnancy wasn't considered a viable policy approach at the conference. some experts said it would be careless -- even reckless. even if detoxing were medically safe, they said, the risk of relapse was too great, putting newborns in danger as soon as they went home.

dr. stephen patrick of vanderbilt university said that he likes towers and admires his work but that there are too many questions.

""my biggest worry about detoxing in pregnancy are rates of relapse,"" says patrick, assistant professor of pediatrics and health policy at vanderbilt and an attending neonatologist.

recent studies have found that women who use opioids have a 40% to 70% rate of relapse, patrick said.

""i would never say that detoxification may not be the right thing for an individual woman, in the right setting with the right supports,"" patrick added. ""it's just that overall, i find it worrisome because of relapse rates.""

one couldn't help but wonder: why would a doctor stake his career on something so risky?

'we can win'

towers, 62, never expected to be a trailblazer in this field. he'd followed the protocol for nearly four decades: never detox an expectant mother because of the possibility of ""fetal demise,"" the clinical term for a stillbirth.

but about the time he arrived at the university of tennessee medical center seven years ago, the opioid epidemic hit. women kept asking why they couldn't detox during pregnancy.

jessica says that getting clean for her baby is one of the best decisions she's ever made. ""i hope our relationship always stays strong.""

he looked into the research, expecting to confirm everything he'd followed for years. ""to my surprise,"" he says, ""i found it came from two case reports.""

those two cases in the 1970s set the course for doctors to advise against detoxification. towers dug further and found that five other, mostly overlooked studies involving about 300 women had been done over a 23-year period beginning in the 1990s. each indicated that detoxification didn't pose a risk to the fetus.

he embarked on his own study and found detox to be safe. ""over the last six years, i've detoxed more than 500 women without a loss,"" he says. ""there really is no data in the literature to support that detoxification will kill the baby. like i said, it came from a propagation of two single case reports in the literature in the 1970s.""

detoxification, he admits, is not for every woman. his patients have horrific back stories that too often include rape, physical abuse and generational addiction. ""each case is complicated,"" he says. ""we never coerce anybody or shame them into detox. the patient has to be interested in this. otherwise, they're not going to succeed.""

like others, towers worries about relapse. when he started his detoxification program, the rate of relapse among the participating mothers was more than 70%, compared with 40% and 60% for all people in addiction treatment nationwide.

four years ago, he hired katz so women could stay in constant contact with his office throughout their pregnancies and for eight weeks after they leave the hospital. he hopes to increase that supervision time to six months to a year. but already, he says, the rate of relapse since adding the behavioral health component has dropped to around 17%.

not a single woman has fatally overdosed after going through his program. ""knock on wood,"" he says.

he gives speeches across the country to spread the news of his research, and he meets with insurance companies in hopes they will pay for it. to deny women who want to get clean the opportunity to do so is wrong, he says, especially as they enter the crucial role of becoming a mother.

""this is a treatable disorder, and we can win,"" he says. ""hopefully, one of these days, we'll change the protocol for the country. we just have to continue plugging away.""

and shouldn't the medical community try to stop generational addiction in the womb, he wonders, rather than allowing the cycle to continue?

towers never intended to be a trailblazer, but he says nothing is better than when a patient tells him, ""you saved my life.""

cnn asked to follow one of towers' patients during the detoxification process. jessica agreed to share her story, but only in the confines of his office. she didn't want to draw attention in her small town and wanted to protect her son from cameras.

""the main thing i want people to know is to take my testimony of where i was to where i am now,"" she says. ""and maybe if it can help one person make a better decision, then it would be worth it.""

she calls towers' office a ""godsend"" for getting her on the road to sobriety, something she says she could never do on her own. when she first came to his office, she was taking 8 milligrams a day of subutex. some days, she took twice that amount.

she'd been told that her baby would die if she tried to detox, so she was following the maintenance therapy program prescribed to her by the previous clinic. she wept when towers told her that if she stayed on that level of subutex, her baby might suffer withdrawal in the weeks following birth.

""i told him i wanted to be off of it, but i just didn't know how to be off of it,"" she says. ""that's what started the whole thing of him helping me.""

jessica works in an assisted-living community. she likes helping the elderly, speaking with them and hearing their life stories. she's pushed through days of feeling horrible and the terrible loneliness brought on by detoxification.

""it's always that wage of war in your mind -- that you feel so crappy. it's so hard to try and do the right thing,"" she says. ""you have those thoughts of, 'why have i done this?' ""

her friend stephanie has talked her off the ledge in moments of desperation. ""when i want to make a stupid decision,"" jessica says, ""she yells at me.""

""i have a really good support system, but i had to choose to walk away from all the negative people in my life.""

jessica has lost more than 10 friends to overdoses in recent years -- a stark reminder of the need to stay sober.

two 'great childhoods' diverged

jessica and stephanie met at church 21 years ago. jessica was 8; stephanie was 9. stephanie immediately stole jessica's bible, starting their relationship off with a tussle.

but soon, a friendship blossomed. they sang in a choir in their hometown of morristown and took up leadership positions in church. through youth group, they went on vacations to places like destin, florida, and dollywood.

jessica's best friend, stephanie moore, has accompanied her to nearly every appointment.

stephanie, the petite one, often ended up underneath her sleeping friend in the backseat on road trips. ""she was always like that,"" stephanie says, holding up photographic proof.

morristown is a picturesque american landscape in the northeastern corner of tennessee, where the tops of mountains dance with the clouds and where us and tennessee flags fly on telephone poles along main street.

places like the timeless elegance tea room occupy space near the jersey girl diner downtown. steps away, the village gunsmith gun store anchors a corner. a sign posted along a country road advertises ""angus bull for sale.""

it was an enjoyable youth. ""we did everything together,"" stephanie says.

adds jessica, ""we really had great childhoods.""

but their lives took disparate paths. when jessica was 14, her father died, sending her into a spiral. she began hanging out with 30-year-old meth users. without even realizing it, she had begun an addiction.

stephanie remembers visiting jessica's home, watching her zoom around the house with a vacuum cleaner, sweating up a storm, zonked out of her mind. stephanie opened one of jessica's makeup kits and found a meth pipe.

""that's when i realized that we're probably not on the same path,"" stephanie recalls.

they drifted apart in high school. jessica became unrecognizable. she was manipulative, cunning, deceitful. she pushed away everyone who loved her.

her mom had always been her rock. but jessica wrecked that relationship. she had an unplanned pregnancy when she was 20. her mom has essentially raised the boy. by 22, jessica's relationship with her mother ""was gone.""

""she was so scared that she was going to get that phone call,"" jessica says, crying.

her meth addiction had only grown. she'd take anything she could get her hands on.

jessica and stephanie have been friends for 21 years. they hope drugs will never get in the way of their friendship again.

three years ago, she underwent back surgery and got hooked on opioids at warp speed. she'd go through a month's worth of prescription pills in a week and scramble to feed her habit for the rest of the month. she couldn't hold down a job.

""i couldn't do anything but be strung out, pretty much,"" she says. ""it just grabs a hold of you, and you lose sight of reality -- and before you know it, it's just too late.""

the opioids provided a high like she'd never felt. like many who get hooked on painkillers, she eventually graduated to heroin, overdosing twice.

""i just wasn't me. you could look at me and see i wasn't there,"" she says. ""they took my life away. they took my soul away.""

she ended up homeless and, at one point, was raped. ""it was just horrible,"" she weeps.

jessica has worked to repair her relationship with her mother -- something ""that i've missed since i was 16 years old."" her mother is supportive of the pregnancy and says she's excited for the birth of her granddaughter. ""she's my no. 1,"" says jessica.

jessica has restored her relationship with her son. she wears a necklace he gave her; on it hangs an infinity sign and the word ""mom.""

""i put him through so much, so much. my mom pretty much had to raise him because i couldn't step up.""

she hopes that will never be the case with her daughter.

at one of her son's football practices last summer, she ran into stephanie. they realized just how much they missed each other. their old friendship was rekindled.

jessica was in stephanie's garden when she learned that she was pregnant. jessica cried, thinking there was no way she could care for the child. stephanie, who has a son about the same age as jessica's, reassured her that the child would be her greatest blessing.

stephanie accompanied jessica to the first ultrasound. when the two heard the heartbeat, they knew they couldn't abandon the pregnancy. she and stephanie would make the journey together. ""i see this baby as mine, too,"" says stephanie.

jessica says her addiction wrecked her closest relationships. she's worked to repair her friendship with her mother. ""for so long, i didn't have her, so i felt like i didn't have anyone.""

stephanie says towers' work has been transformative: ""i have my best friend back, and i would just like to keep her.""

the two got tattoos on their feet not long after jessica began her journey to get clean. their choices reveal the yin and yang of their friendship.

""you keep me safe,"" says stephanie's tattoo.

and jessica's: ""you keep me wild.""

'you got to want it, too'

jessica sits down in a small office with katz to have a heart-to-heart talk.

the nurse stays in near-constant contact with 80 women in the high-risk unit. they text, email and talk by cell phone at all hours.

""we're not going to judge them for their past,"" she says.

katz tells each woman about her brother, who died in 2009 from an overdose of methadone and other drugs. he left behind an 18-month-old boy. the pain of that memory still brings tears eight years later. she promised her young nephew that something good would come from his father's death.

emily katz has proved to be the key at keeping women on track during detoxification. rates of relapse have plummeted since she's joined towers' office.

when she heard that towers needed help, she knew she had a new purpose in life.

""i treat each one of these girls like they're my sister, like they're my best friend, like they're my daughter,"" she says, ""because we have a common denominator.

""every day, this is my passion that i get to sit before these girls. i share my testimony, and they get to share theirs. that relationship builds trust more than just nurse to patient. it's more than that.""

jessica confides that she took 2 milligrams of subutex the day before. ""i wish i wouldn't have even broke down yesterday, but i just couldn't do it,"" she says.

katz looks her in the eyes. ""i know, it's hard,"" she says.

photos: opioids: addictive painkillers photos: opioids: addictive painkillers prescription and illegal opioids are commonly abused because they are so addictive.



opioid medications bind to the areas of the brain that control pain and emotions, driving up levels of the feel-good hormone dopamine in the brain's reward areas and producing an intense feeling of euphoria.



as the brain becomes used to the feelings, it often takes more and more of the drug to produce the same levels of pain relief and well-being, leading to dependence and, later, addiction. hide caption 1 of 12 photos: opioids: addictive painkillers oxymorphone hydrochloride – oxymorphone hydrochloride, under the name opana er, was at the center of an hiv outbreak in indiana in 2015. some addicts began injecting and shared needles increased the spread of hiv.

after an investigation, the fda restricted the use of codeine and tramadol in children under 12 and recommend against their use in children between 12 and 18 years of age. additionally, the fda has warned breastfeeding mothers not to take these medications due to the risk of serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants. hide caption 3 of 12 photos: opioids: addictive painkillers heroin –

however, if abused by crushing and snorting or injecting, it can suppress breathing and cause dizziness, confusion, unconsciousness and death.



subutex, the brand name for buprenorphine, is taken as a tablet placed under the tongue and allowed to dissolve.



the brand suboxone is a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone, an opioid antagonist. antagonists block the opiate receptors in the brain, keeping the narcotic from creating the high abusers crave.

jessica's boyfriend has been the gatekeeper of her subutex pills. katz suggests that the medication be given to stephanie so she can intervene when jessica begins to slide and ask her friend, ""what's going on?""

""that also just gives you a little bit more support -- to make sure that person understands what you're going through, that you're trying to taper and that you're trying not to use,"" katz says.

during those low points, she says, write in a journal about why you're doing this. keep your daughter in your thoughts at all times.

""you're doing so great. i mean, we're so proud of you. we really are,"" katz says. ""i could want this all day long for you, girl, but you got to want it, too.""

in a sign of how much she wants to be free from the grips of addiction, jessica says she hopes that non-opioid painkillers will be used for her c-section. she'd prefer the pain over relapse.

preparing for birth

excitement overflows in the labor and delivery room. it's thursday, april 20. the day has finally come. accompanying jessica are her mother, kathy hill; jessica's 31-year-old boyfriend, jason smith; and stephanie.

jessica has been fully detoxed for 17 days.

jessica is surrounded by friends, family and hospital staff shortly before her c-section on april 20.

stephanie braids jessica's hair to pass the time. they tell the nurse they've been friends for more than 20 years, with major ups and downs. ""it's good now,"" jessica says.

she hoped to avoid a cesarean section, but in the end, a vaginal birth was not an option. the c-section has been planned for shortly after noon. jessica can't contain her giddiness. ""i've been picturing what she might look like,"" she says.

""i'm nervous. i'm just ready to see her,"" jessica says. ""it's been hard, but it's probably one of the best things i've done. for sure.""

there's a chattiness about the room. jessica debates her mom: what football team should her son play on?

there's paperwork galore to be signed, too.

katz pops into the room. jessica greets her with a joke: ""where's dr. towers at? i was about to yell at him if he didn't let you come.""

the two laugh. the night before, they weren't laughing. consumed by an overwhelming sense of impending motherhood, jessica freaked out. she called katz from a different phone than usual. katz was at dinner and let it ring because she didn't recognize the number. immediately, a text pinged katz's phone: ""this is jessica. call me.""

knowing that a fragile state can lead to relapse, katz stopped what she was doing. ""i can't do this,"" jessica told her. ""i'm not ready.""

katz spoke gently and talked her down. she told jessica that she was ready and that she could do this. it was mostly a fear of the unknown -- a vulnerable expectant mother needing someone to speak with in the moment.

says katz: ""i told her, 'you're not going to back out now.' ""

a stream of nurses and medical professionals comes and goes in jessica's room. she'd hoped that both stephanie and her boyfriend could both be in the operating room for the delivery. but towers breaks the bad news: she must choose only one. ""i tried, but there's not enough space,"" he tells her. ""you can be mad at me.""

he encourages her to pick the most supportive person. smiling, jessica says, ""if they fight about it too much, then my mom is going.""

jessica picks her boyfriend, jason smith, to be in the delivery room, but she lectures him not to pass out during the birth.

she ultimately chooses her boyfriend, saying she can't deny him the right to see the moment his daughter is born. soon, dad-to-be is a ball of nerves. he has to leave the room when her iv is inserted; how's he going to handle when her belly is sliced open?

""you better not pass out,"" jessica warns.

the nurse tells him a drape will block the view. ""just sit there and look at her, not to the left or right,"" she advises.

he nods, climbs into jessica's bed and kisses her. mom and stephanie crowd around, and a final selfie is snapped.

at 12:44 p.m., jessica learns that it's time.

""i'll see you in a minute,"" towers says. ""you're going to do good.""

her mom says, ""you got this, honey.""

""good luck,"" adds stephanie.

jessica gets wheeled down the hall to the operating room. on a whiteboard is a message stating today's goal: ""healthy mom & baby!""

welcome, jayda jewel

towers paces outside the operating room, dressed in blue scrubs and a surgical cap. he removes his wedding band and ties it around the drawstring on his pants. he tapes his surgical mask to his face so his glasses won't fog up.

inside, jessica has been given a spinal tap to numb the pain. surgical drapes cover jessica's body, and the room is abuzz with organized chaos.

nurse kirby ginn wheels jessica toward the operating room.

katz pauses outside the room. she prays for god to be with towers and to give jessica the strength to get through the surgery and for the child to be born healthy. then she heads into the room.

""you're doing great, jessica,"" says dr. kim fortner, a member of the medical team. ""we're all right here. it's almost over, ok?""

a look of excruciating pain spreads across jessica's face.

""think about her sweet baby cheeks, jessica,"" says nurse kirby ginn.

moments later, at 1:32 p.m., a beautiful baby girl with chubby cheeks and a patch of brown hair emerges. jayda jewel hill lets out two loud screams.

towers and his team quickly clean her up and swaddle her in a blanket adorned with teddy bears. she weighs in at 6 pounds and stretches 17 inches.

""are you ready to see her?"" the nurse asks.

""yes, ma'am,"" jessica replies.

her daughter is placed across her chest. jessica cradles her with both hands, her right hand patting her back.

""aww,"" jessica says.

""she looks great,"" towers says.

the baby coughs a few times, worrying jessica.

""why is she coughing like that?"" she says.

jayda jewel hill was born at 1:32 p.m. april 20. she was born with fluid in her lungs, requiring her to be monitored for much of the evening in the neonatal intensive care unit.

caught up in the moment, the father seems to miss the question, asking a nurse to take a photo of him with his daughter.

he clutches the swaddled newborn and leans in next to jessica's face -- the birthing room in the era of social media. ""hi, little gorgeous. hi there, beautiful. look, there's your momma,"" the gleeful father says.

the baby coughs a few more times. ""is she ok?"" jessica asks.

towers explains that the baby sucked in amniotic fluid during surgery. the fluid will be removed from her lungs; it's nothing to be worried about, he assures her.

katz leans in and holds jessica's right hand. she tells her to stay strong, that her daughter is healthy. she tells her the baby is going to be taken away to be observed in the neonatal intensive care unit.

just before stitching jessica up, towers uses a non-opioid drug similar to novocaine to dull the pain for 24 hours. jessica also receives tylenol iv and an anti-inflammatory drug, toradol.

""she's hoping to not need any pain pills,"" he says. ""it is major surgery. your abdomen is open, so it hurts.""

anything to avoid relapse.

bucking the trend

less than 24 hours after the birth, more than 150 doctors, nurse practitioners and other health officials from across east tennessee gather in an auditorium at the ut medical center.

on stage, towers steps through a slideshow presentation of opioid use disorder in pregnancy. he reels off stats from the cdc: from 2000 to 2015, more than half a million people died from drug overdoses, including 183,000 people from prescription opioids. ""unfortunately, we're only getting worse,"" he says.

in tennessee, he notes, three people die from overdoses every day. he talks about his findings, of the women who've detoxed in his program. ""we're bucking the trend,"" towers says.

as is tradition, the newborn's footprints were stamped shortly after birth. jayda jewel weighed in at 6 pounds and stretched 17 inches.

""i'm passionate because i just believe it's the right way to do medicine,"" he says. ""we don't always succeed. i don't know anyone who succeeds all the time when dealing with addiction. but my passion comes from the ones that we've delivered that don't have (withdrawal) and the look in the mother's eye when they say, 'you saved my life.'

""i don't think you can get any better response from a patient.""

shortly after the speech, he takes an elevator to the third floor and visits jessica and her baby. jessica sports a pink t-shirt that says ""don't want to be here.""

""we want to be home,"" she says.

jayda jewel, nicknamed jj, looks like the perfect child, with big eyes, content in her mother's arms. she shows no signs of withdrawal, although symptoms can take a couple of days to appear.

jessica hugs the doctor. ""i couldn't have done this without you and emily,"" she says.

outside towers' presence, stephanie repeats that sentiment, telling jessica, ""you're so lucky you got him.""

""if it weren't for this baby, you might not have got off subutex ever.""

over the next several days, jayda jewel exhibits no signs of withdrawal, but jessica's pain intensifies. she's given three vicodin pills, an opioid painkiller. the typical c-section patient gets 10, towers says.

jessica had hoped to be given an opioid blocker called vivitrol, which can resist the urge to use for up to a month. but to get it, her system must be clear of opioids for seven days. towers expects to be able to give her the medicine in her followup appointment. ""she felt bad about that,"" he says.

the door to jessica's recovery room celebrates the life of her new daughter. jayda jewel, nicknamed jj, did not suffer withdrawal.

but still, she succeeded. her baby was born healthy.

four days after the birth, jessica straps jayda jewel in a car seat in her hospital room and then climbs into a wheelchair to be escorted out of the facility. mom and daughter head down an elevator and out the front door.

towers and katz meet them at their car. jessica places her baby inside and turns toward them.

""we made it,"" jessica says, wrapping her arms around her ""nurse barbie."" ""i love you.""

""i love you, too,"" katz responds.

then jessica hugs towers again.

THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Houston","randolph, new jersey (cnn) ten young children sit around a table as lila kagedan walks into their synagogue's after-school program. paper plates filled with art supplies are waiting for them to tear into.

kagedan introduces herself as the new rabbi at their synagogue. not one of the elementary-school-aged children seems surprised.

but her announcement is surprising -- historic, even: kagedan, of mount freedom jewish center, is the first woman to have the title of rabbi serving an orthodox congregation.

it is a job she has dreamed of holding since she was a little girl, but rabbinical school did not exist for women in the orthodox movement for most of her life.

""growing up the only model of rabbi in the orthodox world were men,"" kagedan says. ""so in some ways this really didn't feel like an option.""

calling herself 'rabbi kagedan'

rabbi lila kagedan says she ""wanted my title to be the most accurate description of my training.""

kagedan, 35, grew up in an orthodox jewish family in montreal. her father, who passed away two years ago, was her ""greatest teacher,"" studying jewish texts with her on most nights and urging her to follow her dream.

""i wouldn't say that he told me that there were no barriers -- i would say that he had no idea how this would come about,"" kagedan says. ""his message to me was to arm myself with the rabbinate texts, to know them intimately. but he cautioned me not to be angry. and if i was feeling angry about exclusion to take that anger and do something very productive with it.""

kagedan spent years studying bioethics around the world, but always continued studying jewish texts with the hope that she could one day attend rabbinical school. and then, in 2009, a school called yeshivat maharat opened with the hope of helping women achieve leadership positions in the orthodox jewish community. kagedan graduated in its third class.

there have been orthodox jewish women before her who took the title ""rabba,"" but kagedan was firm in wanting to be called rabbi kagedan.

""i knew that i wanted my title to be the most accurate description of my training,"" kagedan says. ""i didn't want to walk into a room or a space and have there be any ambiguity of what it is that i was there to do. what my training was. what my skill set was.""

the idea of a female rabbi is not accepted by everyone in orthodox judaism. the rabbinical council of america (rca), an organization made up of orthodox rabbis, passed a resolution in october 2015 in response to kagedan's school, yeshivat maharat, ordaining women as rabbis, calling it ""a violation of our mesorah [tradition]"" and saying the school's decision to do so was ""a path that contradicts the norms of our community.""

when asked about kagedan's new position, rabbi mark dratch, the rca's executive vice president, said the organization ""encourages a diversity of [sanctioned] and communally appropriate opportunities for learned, committed women,"" but it does not accept the ordination or recognition of women as orthodox rabbis.

kagedan says she is a product of rca education and that her greatest teachers were part of the organization. but, she hopes the group will come around to the idea of women leading congregations.

kagedan says she is certain ""only positive outcomes will emerge from having men and women working in the rabbinate and being accessible to the community.""

""women need to see other women in these leadership positions to keep them motivated in their judaism, to have leaders that they can relate to, that they can feel comfortable with in different ways that they might not feel comfortable with their male leadership,"" kagedan says. ""i guarantee you only positive outcomes will emerge from having men and women working in the rabbinate and being accessible to the community.""

kagedan says she has been warmly welcomed by members of the mount freedom jewish center, about an hour outside of new york city, where her primary focus will be teaching. she sees herself as a rabbi there to serve both men and women, but understands why her position is so important to women in her congregation.

""i hope to normalize women in leadership roles,"" she says. ""when i look out at the community and i see ... young girls, i hope that they get a sense that anything is possible. that nothing is out of their reach. and that it might be a tremendous struggle and it might come with tremendous sadness and frustration but that if they want something badly enough it's their responsibility to create a mood where this can come about.""

bigger than just her

kagedan's life is delicate balancing act between upholding orthodox jewish traditions that are dear to her, and pushing her own boundaries in this new role.

being a female rabbi has its range of challenges in an orthodox setting -- even where to stand.

rabbi menashe east, shown with his daughter ayala, hired kagedan at mount freedom jewish center.

in orthodox synagogues, men and women sit separately in the sanctuary when they pray, with a divider separating them. at mount freedom jewish center, men sit on the right side of the room, and women sit on the left. the rabbi stands on the right.

kagedan discussed this with rabbi menashe east, who hired her at the synagogue. where could she stand when giving a sermon to the congregation? they chatted for a few minutes about how to simultaneously embrace her monumental new role while respecting the rules and traditions of the religion their ancestors have preserved for centuries.

the impact of kagedan's appointment at the beginning of 2016 is already being felt. a month or so after east introduced her to the congregation, he asked his eldest daughter what she wants to be when she grows up.

""'maybe i'll be a rabbi,'"" east recalls her saying. ""''yeah, i could be like rabbi lila.'"" THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Houston",rabbi lila kagedan: orthodox woman becomes first to take title

yet for children with cerebral palsy , a group of neurological disorders that affect the ability to move, simply walking can be difficult -- and some with cerebral palsy might not be able to walk at all.

now, a team of researchers from the national institutes of health clinical center in the united states has created a robotic exoskeleton that could help many of these children walk easier.

the researchers recently demonstrated in a study that the exoskeleton -- which looks more like superhero armor than medical equipment -- was safe and well-tolerated and could be worn while the children walked on their own.

the researchers also demonstrated that improvements in walking with the exoskeleton increased over time as the children continued to use it, according to the study, published in august in the journal science translational medicine

cerebral palsy is caused by abnormal development in the part of the brain that controls movement. although there is no cure, supportive treatments, medications and surgery can help improve motor skills.

in the us, cerebral palsy is the most common motor disability in childhood, affecting about one in 323 children, according to the centers for disease control and prevention . in the united kingdom, about one in 400 children has a type of cerebral palsy, according to the national health service

'the children were pretty excited'

the recent exoskeleton study involved seven children with cerebral palsy, 5 to 19 years old, who all had some difficulty walking due to crouch gait, in which the knees are excessively flexed.

over a period of about eight to 12 weeks, each child was tested in the exoskeleton and practiced walking with the technology in a lab across the floor and on a treadmill during six visits with the researchers. each visit lasted about a couple of hours, of which about 30 minutes to an hour was spent walking over ground.

the researchers found that, as the children walked across the lab floor, the exoskeleton reduced crouch by changing their posture and assisting in the extension of their knees.

while wearing the exoskeleton, six of the seven children showed posture and walking improvements equivalent to or greater than improvements typically seen from invasive orthopedic surgery, the researchers noted in the study.

""most of the children were pretty excited to feel the way that this device changed how they walked,"" said thomas bulea, staff scientist in the center's rehabilitation medicine department and lead author of the study.

""more striking was the reaction we saw on a lot of the parents' faces,"" he said. ""several, if not most of them, expressed surprise at the visible effects of the exoskeleton during walking.""

yet more research is needed before robotic exoskeletons could be made available to children with cerebral palsy nationwide.

after all, the study involved a small number of participants. the robotic exoskeleton needs to be tested with many more children before it could be made widely available, bulea said.

""the biggest limitation is that this was a relatively small study,"" he said, adding that it involved only children with crouch gait from cerebral palsy who were able to walk on their own without crutches or a walker.

""so generalizing the results of the study beyond the sample with that inclusion criterion should be done with caution,"" he said, adding that the researchers plan to continue testing the exoskeleton on other children and conditions.

""the big question that we're looking to answer going forward is, how do these improvements in walking and muscle activity that we see with the exoskeleton affect their walking in the long term?"" bulea said.

""how does it, or does it, change their walking pattern when they're not using the exoskeleton? and that's a question that is still very much open,"" he said. ""we're still a long way off from this being a commercially available product. we're excited by the promise that this initial study showed, but we still have to do more studies to establish the effectiveness of this as a rehabilitation device.""

'in the future, i expect we will see more and more exoskeletons'

steven collins, associate professor of mechanical engineering at stanford university, called the results ""very promising.""

""the exoskeleton was able to reduce crouch to a similar degree as some surgeries, without being invasive,"" said collins, who was not involved in the study.

yet the long-term impact of using exoskeletons remains to be tested, he said.

in the study, children did not use the exoskeleton over a prolonged time period, collins said, and the data showed that there was some muscle resistance to the device even though it was improving their posture.

""it's not clear whether that would change with prolonged use,"" collins said.

""in the future, i expect we will see more and more exoskeletons like this used in children's medicine,"" he said. ""exoskeletons are versatile and controllable, so they can adapt alongside their users. in some cases, this may make them better than surgery.""

michael goldfarb, who has developed lower-limb exoskeletons for adults paralyzed below the waist with his team, said he often receives emails and phone calls from parents of children with cerebral palsy asking whether such devices are available for youngsters.

(cnn) donald trump was not on the ballot in virginia's race for governor on tuesday, but his bigoted political playbook certainly was. and thankfully the voters of virginia sent a message that they reject trump's fearmongering and divisiveness by electing democrat ralph northam .

let's not play games: trump, his party and his former top adviser, steve bannon, were all very invested in the gop nominee, ed gillespie. not only had trump tweeted numerous times over the past month supporting gillespie, including on election day, but over the weekend bannon was publicly bragging that gillespie would win because he had embraced ""trump's agenda"" and ""the trump-stewart talking points,"" referring to corey stewart, who almost upset gillespie in the primary.

well, bannon was right about one thing, gillespie did embrace trump's agenda. in september, gillespie went through a metamorphosis. but instead of a caterpillar turning into a beautiful butterfly, gillespie transformed from a mainstream republican into a trump clone complete with racist dog whistles and more.

what makes this transformation so stark is that before his primary campaign against stewart -- a ""mini-trump"" who channeled his anti-immigrant and pro-confederate statues philosophy -- gillespie, a former republican national committee chairman and lobbyist, had, as far back as 2006, criticized republicans who had spewed anti-immigrant views.

but that all changed this fall, when ""establishment ed,"" as stewart had mockingly nicknamed gillespie during the primary, started running ads that in trumpesque fashion scared voters into believing that latino street gangs were coming to kill them and their families. in fact, gillespie cited the identical street gang, ms-13, that trump is fond of invoking. and just like trump, gillespie hyped up the threat to the point that washington post fact checkers deemed it a "" two pinocchios "" exaggeration.

and in october, we saw gillespie echoing trump's post-charlottesville defense of confederate statues and running ads saying, ""i'm for keeping them up and he's for taking them down,"" referring to his democratic opponent, northam.

in fact, it almost seemed like gillespie and trump had coordinated their messaging over the last month of the campaign on these inflammatory issues. for example, in october, trump praised gillespie, tweeting : ""ed gillespie will turn the really bad virginia economy #'s around, and fast. strong on crime, he might even save our great statues/heritage!""

and on election day, trump took a break from his asia trip to unleash a series of tweets supporting gillespie, including one specifically citing the latino street gang ms-13: ""@edwgillespie will totally turn around the high crime and poor economic performance of va. ms-13 and crime will be gone. vote today, asap!""

but trump and the gop's support for gillespie went far beyond tweets. no matter what trump tweeted about gillespie on election night -- that he ""worked hard"" but didn't embrace what trump stands for -- there's little doubt that trump, as a gop president, is a big reason why the republican leadership went ""all in"" on this race , with the republican governors association giving his campaign over $8 million, according to the nonpartisan virginia public access project.

trump and the gop apparently were using virginia as a test lab. they wanted to see if trump's race-baiting political playbook, updated to include the local issue of confederate statues, would work to flip a state that trump lost by 5 points last november. but thankfully the people of virginia said no. if gillespie had won, there's no doubt other republicans would've mimicked the same strategy in 2018, since politicians tend to copy formulas that work.

does this mean trump's tactics of dividing americans against each other, ginning up fear of immigrants and appealing to white supremacy are dead come the 2018 elections? not by a long shot. but it may make some republicans think twice before going full trump. and at the very least, the people of virginia made it clear that they reject trump's bigoted political playbook.

(cnn) in my house, we called it going boneless. that's when my girls, as toddlers, would arch their backs, screaming uncontrollably, usually in a public place (of course!) and there was nothing my husband or i could do to satisfy them.

if you have kids and you've experienced one of their meltdowns, you no doubt know what i mean and what it feels like at that moment, when you are a mixture of emotions -- embarrassed, frustrated, angry and completely at a loss for how to resolve the problem. even bribery, which we know is never the way to go, doesn't seem to work when your child is at wit's end and unable to calm down.

we recently asked some parents to act out what their children do and say when they melt down as part of a new cnn digital video series called ""parent acts."" since we know parents tend to get the best advice and support from other parents, we thought it would be fun and helpful for parents to act out what their kids are doing when there is a problem, and then have a parenting expert listen to their role play and weigh in with advice.

pauline hilborn, a mom of two in new york city, describes herself as an expert on meltdowns based on the experiences of her daughter, who she says is ""7-years-old but sounds more like 13.""

case in point: hilborn's daughter wanted a ponytail like the pop singer ariana grande, but felt like her mom didn't do the ponytail properly and put it in the wrong place.

""she came out crying and said, 'ariana grande's ponytail is here not here,'"" said hilborn, pointing to the place on her head where her daughter preferred the ponytail to go, not where it ended up.

debi, another mother of two in manhattan, says her 7-year-old has definitely had some tantrums. when i asked her son what a meltdown is, he told me it's when you cry a lot. when i asked him to imitate one, he said he keeps screaming until his mom lets him have whatever it is that he wants at that moment.

""i completely freeze in those situations,"" she said. ""i lose all rational sense of now what do i do ... i don't know how to do it without bribing him, so i end up taking away things.""

help is on the way

family therapist tricia ferrara is author of ""parenting 2.0.""

ferrara listened to our parent volunteers imitate exactly what their children do and say during a meltdown, and then offered her advice:

no. 1 -- try to prevent it

yes, you can actually prevent a meltdown, said ferrara, a mom of two teens. kids get tired and hungry, and then they can't tell you what's going on. ""you want to try and maybe not bring a child to places that trigger them,"" and avoid outings at the end of the day when it's still difficult for them to coordinate their emotions with their body, she said. (i wish i had this in mind that time i decided to take my kids, then 2 and 4, grocery shopping right before dinner time. not a smart move.)

no. 2 -- disregard what other people think

while it may be hard to do, we need to forget about the other people watching us during those cringe-worthy moments when our kids are yelling at the top of their lungs and people are definitely noticing. ""i always say to parents ... you've got to stop, drop and do what you have to do,"" she said. ""escalating back to the child is not helping anything, because that's more sensory information that is going to make them go nuclear."" think of yourself as a ""tuning fork,"" said ferrara. ""the calmer and clearer you can be, the better things will go.""

no. 3 -- create a small upside for them

adults sometimes have to look for creative ways to maintain authority, and eliciting small concessions from your child can go a long way, said ferrara. ""create one bit of upside even if it's, 'you take one breath and we count to three together [then] we can get you want you want, and then we'll go home,' she explained. ""what that does is it keeps you in control and as the authority in the situation.""

no. 4 -- don't leave home without a strategy

the ""biggest mistake"" parents make is they go into situations ""without a strategy,"" said ferrara. ""do you go to the hair dresser without a plan? a business meeting? go buy a car? no, but we always allow ourselves to fall into these potholes with our kids with no plan,"" she said.

remember debi, the mom who said her son sometimes has meltdowns when he can't get what he wants? ferrara said before heading out or going anywhere, she could tell her son that how he behaves is going to determine whether he could do something else, such as play with his birthday presents that evening.

""and so when he starts to behave in a way that is not acceptable to you, instead of getting into the verbal joust with him, you can say, 'do you want to play with your birthday presents?' you can remain clear and calm and communicate in a way that he understands,"" said ferrara to debi. ""if you rock back a bit and anticipate a little more and be a little more strategic, you might get better results from him,"" she said. ""and after consistency, he's going to know, 'oh it's a new day.'""

no. 5 -- help children convey how they feel

when the body is flailing, that often means the language is not working, said ferrara. for example, in the case of hilborn, the mom who's daughter melted down after the ponytail disaster, ferrara said she could have said to her daughter, ""honey, if you need help, say it. say 'mom, i need help changing the ponytail.' that language helps her organize herself.""

""you want your child to have an expectation of things, but she can't beat up on other people to get there, and certainly you can't stand in for that,"" ferrara said to hilborn. ""so what you want to do is teach her to say, 'i need help. i want this changed,' and then you can move in a more functional way.""

THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Houston","(cnn) after uploading those carefully selected profile photos and writing a well-crafted personal bio for a dating app, you're now thinking, ""what type of person am i actually looking for?""

dating apps and sites offer the option to filter matches by sex, ethnicity, height or religion -- but they could be even more personal.

this summer, the gay social networking app grindr caught some criticism for asking in a user survey ""what is your current hiv status?"" and ""how would you feel if grindr allowed you to filter the guys you see by hiv status?""

in a statement, a grindr representative said the survey is an effort to better understand its users and to encourage discussions.

""we have observed a significant increase in user profiles openly discussing their hiv status and test dates. given that this has not been a part of our profile options to date, we are surveying users to determine both their desire to share this information, and ways to prevent stigma and provide proper support,"" the statement said. ""sometimes this involves asking uncomfortable questions.""

screenshots of the survey were posted online by daniel reeders , a ph.d. candidate who studies hiv stigma at australian national university. he got the images from a colleague, he said, and called the filter a ""digital quarantine.""

""dating sites and apps shouldn't ask for hiv status, because there's no way to guarantee that privacy and safety will be protected for people who disclose they are positive,"" reeders said. ""the harassment that 'poz' (hiv-positive) people face can be extreme, even though it's from a small segment of the community. people already have the ability to disclose their status in their profile text, if they choose to do so.""

indeed, public health and relationship experts suggest that hiv or other std filters on a dating app might do more harm than good.

more harm than good?

although an hiv filter could have the benefit of letting hiv-positive people meet others -- avoiding potentially awkward and stigmatizing conversations -- it also could have a dark side: creating a false sense of security, said dr. eric schrimshaw , associate professor of sociomedical sciences at columbia university.

some states have laws that mandate the disclosure of hiv status prior to any kind of sexual activity. but for some, a dating app filter could lead hiv-negative people to think that the filtered matches consist of only hiv-negative people, he said. from there, they might engage in unprotected sex.

this could lead to hiv infections because ""one, the potential partner might not be telling the truth in order to be able to get partners or to avoid stigma, and also the person may simply have engaged in behaviors recently that result in status change that they just don't know yet.""

another concern is that such filters could increase stigma and discrimination against people living with hiv by further isolating them socially and ""demonizing the population.""

""with more hiv stigma and discrimination, you are going to have less people who will get tested,"" said dr. gary harper , a public health professor at the university of michigan

since most stds are temporary and treatable, such as gonorrhea and chlamydia, people are more likely to seek treatment as soon as possible, harper said; they wouldn't even think to include them in their dating profiles. but a filter for any incurable std, like herpes, could increase stigma, experts said.

harper added that imposing a filter on dating app users takes away privacy rights: you may no longer have control over who can disclose information about your hiv status on an online network of strangers.

dating apps and the rise of stds

online dating sites and mobile dating applications where users can create profiles and meet with strangers, have become increasingly popular among americans. according to the pew research center , about 15% of adults in the united states are now using online or mobile matchmaking services to seek potential partners, a 36% increase from 2013.

some link the ease of seeking casual sexual partners to the spread of stds. last year, the rhode island health department attributed an increase in std cases to ""using social media to arrange casual and often anonymous sexual encounters.""

of craigslist led to a 16% increase in hiv cases across 33 states. lead author dr. a 2013 study found that the usageof craigslist led to a 16% increase in hiv cases across 33 states. lead author dr. jason chan , an assistant professor at the university of minnesota, said that although he would expect hiv cases to rise given the trend in dating app use, as people are becoming more cautious about sex, hiv might not necessarily spread.

harper said the relationship between dating apps and the spread of hiv is more complicated than one might think. the association could have more to do with a user's existing tendency to engage in risky sexual behaviors and the prevalence of hiv and other stds in one's dating pool and area.

because of the complexity of the issue, an hiv filtering feature on dating apps would not necessarily be an effective prevention measure, said dr. renata sanders , an assistant professor at johns hopkins university school of medicine.

""there is no evidence suggesting that by dividing people by their hiv status on a mobile app where people meet would work to prevent hiv,"" sanders said. ""what actually helps prevent hiv is knowing your status and using effective measures to curb hiv spread such as condoms and prep,"" a pill that can prevent the virus.

what are the alternatives?

instead of a filter, experts said, it would be better to leave the choice to users.

letting users self-report hiv and std status on their profiles could open up conversations and prevent misunderstandings that might lead to infection, and it ""helps create a norm or a culture on the app where that's a topic that gets discussed prior to meeting,"" said schrimshaw of columbia university.

some apps, in fact, are already doing that. for example, hornet , a dating app for gay men, has a ""know your status"" feature that allows users to disclose one of five hiv statuses: ""negative,"" ""negative on prep,"" ""positive,"" ""positive undetectable"" and ""unknown."" the app also allows hiv-positive users to search for other positive people, but hiv-negative users don't have the ability to look for only negative users.

dr. ian holloway , a public affairs professor at the university of california, los angeles, said hornet's positive-only search feature can be helpful for hiv-positive men to seek not only partners, but social support and advice. without giving the search to hiv-negative men, the feature could prevent users from having a false sense of security and encourage them to have conversations about hiv with their partners.

alex garner, hornet's senior health innovation strategist, said it is an effort to encourage thoughtful conversation about hiv and gay men's sexual health and to ""bridge the divide between hiv-positive and -negative people.""

dating apps and sites can play a powerful role in raising awareness about hiv and std prevention without fueling stigmas or discrimination, researchers said.

join the conversation see the latest news and share your comments with cnn health on facebook and twitter.

for example, holloway's 2013 study found that more than 80% of grindr users in southern california are willing to participate in hiv prevention programs delivered online or through mobile apps. the study suggests that apps with geolocating features may consider providing quick reference to nearby hiv testing locations as a way to encourage more men to get tested, raise awareness and help facilitate access to community services.

another recent study found that grindr was an effective way to give out hiv self-test kits to men at risk of infection and reduce the spread of hiv.

sanders, the johns hopkins professor, thinks it is good practice for apps and sites to send out alerts and information about hiv and std prevention and treatment, such as how often one should get tested for which kinds of std and what should get checked when going to see a doctor.

one of the key points of trump's speech was the contrast between north and south korea.

both countries were also ruled by dictatorial strongmen until the late 1980s , when south korea finally transitioned to a fully civilian, democratic government. since then, the country's fortunes have far surpassed north korea's.

'why would china feel an obligation to help north korea?'

as the north korean issue has consumed the first year of his presidency, trump has been adamant that beijing must do more to rein in its longtime ally.

echoing comments made earlier this week, trump called on ""every nation, including china and russia, to fully implement un security council resolutions, downgrade diplomatic relations with the regime, and sever all ties of trade and technology.""

he heads to the chinese capital later wednesday, and, amid a litany of alleged north korean human rights abuses, he gave an example of why beijing should be wary of its neighbor.

""north korean women are forced to abort babies that are considered ethnically inferior. and if these babies are born, the newborns are murdered,"" trump said. ""one woman's baby born to a chinese father was taken away in a bucket. the guard said it did not deserve to live because it was impure.""

appealing to china's morality is a different tack for trump, and may be a preview of how he plans to approach the north korea issue with president xi jinping.

imagine being able to see all the colors of the spectrum one moment, and only black and white the next. you'd think that you were missing something -- that the gray was just a stripped-down vision of reality.

but for centuries, painters have intentionally purged color from their art as a way of making it more nuanced and complex. from jan van eyck, rembrandt and ingres, to degas, picasso and gerhard richter, artists have created -- and recreated -- images in monochrome to enhance their work.

""people think of 20th-century abstract artists as the ones who turned to black or white, but painters over the centuries who were great colorists elected to (drastically) restrict their palettes,"" said lelia packer, co-curator of the first major exhibition to explore the subject.

featuring around 70 paintings, many of which are on loan from institutions and private collections from around the world, "" monochrome: painting in black and white "" at london's national gallery proves how much can be gained from the absence of color.

an artistic tradition

this story begins, like so many others in western art, with the church. in the 12th century, cistercian monks limited the amount of color used in stained glass windows to curtail sensory stimulation and encourage more meditative worship. a few centuries later, in the early northern renaissance, the pious would throw cloths over their vibrantly painted altarpieces during lent.

luckier members of the flock were able to hide their richly colored art from sight with shutters painted in grisaille -- images entirely composed of gray or neutral tones. these outer panels might not have boasted the bright pigments of the artworks they concealed, but they were no less fun to look at.

one of the earliest works in the exhibition, a set of exterior oak panels for a portable altarpiece by flemish master hans memling, features two grisaille images laboriously rendered to resemble chiseled stone statues. mimicking sculptures was a clever solution to the challenge of abandoning color.

""the annunciation diptych (the archangel gabriel; the virgin mary),"" (about 1433-1435).

but it was also a practice at the heart of the heated rivalry between painters and sculptors during the italian renaissance, according to packer.

""(there) was a famous debate called the paragone -- a comparison between the arts,"" she said. ""michelangelo and leonardo both wrote about it. basically, sculptors were criticizing painters for only being able to represent in two dimensions.""

painters responded by using monochrome to show how the play of light and shadow gives volume to form. the venetian powerhouse titian took this idea to the extreme in the painting ""portrait of a lady"" (circa 1510--12), which shows a woman above what appears to be a bust of her own profile carved in stone.

over the years, imitation sculptures became fashionable optical illusions used in interior design -- they mimicked stone without the cost. but artists knew other ways to impress in black and white.

in fact, some painters chose to reproduce color paintings in monochrome as a way of showing off -- most likely to other artists. it proved that they had the skill required to master light and shade without color. years after completing his provocative ""grande odalisque"" (1814) -- one of the most famous nude female backs of all time -- the french neo-classical master jean-dominique ingres rendered the image in black and white to demonstrate his mastery of painting gradations of shading.

""it was a way of better understanding the fall of light on a variety of surfaces,"" said packer.

modernism in monochrome

as printmaking spread in the 16th and 17th centuries, artists understood that replicating their paintings meant reaching a wider audience. as such, painters began transforming polychromatic masterpieces into black and white as a guide for printmakers, who needed to translate the images into linear designs for the printing press.

but by the 20th century the flip side of this practice emerged when artists like picasso, warhol and richter started working in black and white to imitate the mass production of mechanical printing.

picasso famously imitated newsprint in paintings like ""guernica"" (1937). but he also restricted his palette while imitating the spanish old masters in artworks like 1957's ""las meninas (infanta margarita maría),"" part of his abstracted 58-painting homage to the painter diego velásquez. reducing the scene to black and white dramatizes it with stark contrast and dark, frenzied lines.

""he paints very swiftly,"" said packer. ""he's responding to his great predecessor and trying to outdo him. it's about competition.""

and no exhibition on monochrome art would be complete without works by some of the 20th-century radicals like frank stella, who covered canvases with lines of black enamel house paint to show that they are not illusionary windows but objects, or jasper johns, who turned familiar symbols gray (like the american flag) to make them unfamiliar and therefore, ironically, more visible. the latter artist is represented by a 2007 collage that resembles flagstones painted on wooden shutters -- an unlikely contemporary cousin to the altarpieces of centuries past.

yet, it is a surprising burst of bright yellow that greets visitors at the end of the exhibition. it's a recreation of ""room for one colour (1997), an immersive installation by the icelandic-danish installation artist olafur eliasson, who has hung mustard-yellow lights in an empty room painted white.

""everything the light hits is transformed into shades of gray,"" explained packer. ""it's how your eye perceives the color.""

the purpose, as eliasson explains in the show's catalog, is to make the viewer's eye see more than it usually does. our eyes, he writes, ""can detect more shade of gray in a black-and-white photograph than shades of color in a color image.""

consider it a kind of superpower that artists have, apparently, been wise to for centuries. THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for San Antonio",masters of monochrome

perry continues to equate fossil fuels with electricity even though africa and the developing world are now investing more in renewable energy than the richest countries on the planet. his presidential campaign, in fact, criticized the obama administration for sending $500 million dollars to ""the country solyndra."" maybe perry was in africa trying to talk to the energy secretary of solyndra, and recover our tax money.

i'll look for an announcement regarding détente with solyndra.

the man has never been keen on facts or geography. as he launched his presidential campaign, perry informed the electorate that, ""juarez is one of the most dangerous cities in america."" i checked google maps. nope, no juarez, america. but just across the rio grande is el paso, ranked safest city in the us, and i know perry's been there, so how does he muck that up?

maybe he's just not good with anything latino. bragging about their opportunities in texas, perry pointed in a speech to the head of the texas alcoholic beverage commission, jose cuevas, and told the audience in a cringe-worthy play on cuevas's name, ""that is the right job for that man."" a few in the crowd probably hit the lobby bar for a shot of jose cuervo to see if the alcohol might be more numbing than the ignorance.

explanations are often offered for perry's rhetorical bumbling, but his flubs are too consistent for him to be constantly drunk. in one famous new hampshire speech during the campaign, he appeared to many observers to have washed down the painkillers for his back problems with a few glasses of wine, and sounded like he was having a religious experience when he was offered a commemorative jar of jam.

worse, though, is how he comports himself as an ambassador of the oil industry. perry never bothered to read the job description when he became energy secretary. could that be because it was a government institution he had vowed to eliminate

the agency's primary role is husbanding this country's nuclear arsenal and conducting technical research on how to create more and better sources of power, but he may be thinking political power instead of electrical. the people who drink deeply of ""dinosaur wine"" have long fattened perry's political wallet.

let's stipulate, though, that light is better than dark when it comes to acts of sexual violence, but we also ought to acknowledge that equating electrical illumination and safety with oil is nonsensical, and an insulting conflation of two problems. there is also no shortage of people and organizations that argue that what the extraction industry has done to the planet is a rank form of violence, and what happens to communities in its periphery isn't diminished by turning on the lights.

when i was following george w. bush around the country on his campaign, linguistic entertainment was a staple of every day. we were moved by his exhortations to, ""make the pie higher,"" (had no idea it was short) and his acknowledgment that it is difficult to, ""put food on your family,"" (the kids won't sit still for mashed potatoes on their heads?) or his willingness to ask those tough questions like, ""is our children learning?""

and it's good to know perry is keeping our texas traditions alive. he even thanked bush for ""defending us from freedom,"" though i think mr. trump is doing a better job at that particular task. i don't know if it's a better idea for the energy secretary to concentrate on his mighty responsibility of manufacturing nuclear weapons or to just babble on about oil and rape and electricity.

but i do kind of wonder if his back is bothering him again. THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Seattle","oops, rick perry does it again"

THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Denver","(cnn) — it's been nearly 38 years since philippine airlines unveiled the first fully flat bed on a commercial jet in the shape of slim, bunk-style ""skybeds"" on the first class upper deck of its boeing 747.

that luxury was short-lived, and airlines mostly spent the ensuing decades plotting ways to stuff more and more passengers onto their planes, no matter the class.

luckily trends change, and the past few years has seen a resurgence in airlines providing for personal space, privacy, and -- yes -- a quality rest.

singapore airlines has now revealed the latest luxury sleeps in the sky, thanks to an investment of $850 million dollars in its aircraft interiors, bringing about ""suites"" that look more like hotel rooms, and business class seats that convert to double beds.

luxury suites

double the luxury: singapore airline's new business class beds and suites. courtesy singapore airlines

if this news triggers déjà vu, it's because the airline has been offering double beds in its highest class of service for a decade, beginning in 2007 with the arrival of the first airbus a380 to enter commercial service.

""our original suites were the first to offer double beds in the sky and they are still regarded as the ultimate in premium travel,"" goh choon phong, chief executive at the carrier, said during the unveiling in singapore of the latest designs. ""not only are we retaining that feature, but now the beds are even more plush and comfortable than before.""

singapore airline says its suites are the product of an $850 million investment. courtesy singapore airlines

there are six suites at the front of the a380's upper deck, and each may be individually closed off from the aisle by sliding, half-height doors.

within, a passenger is equipped with a 76-inch-long bed separate from the seat, though the latter boasts a 270-degree swivel and 45-degree recline for dining (with wedgwood china), getting work done (over high-speed, inmarsat global xpress satellite wi-fi) and, or simply daydreaming out the windows before it's time for rest.

a 32-inch high-definition tv, lalique amenity kit, leather-lined storage nooks, and a touchscreen control tablet for entertainment and lighting complete the experience.

focus on quality

singapore airlines says it wants its suites to enhance the privacy of fliers. courtesy singapore airlines

despite the bells and whistles, the focus for the new suites is overwhelmingly on providing quality time to the guest, hence the abundance of privacy.

it's a consideration frequent business travelers such as gary degregorio, an executive at global technology consultancy thoughtworks , can well appreciate.

""those traveling on business in c-level roles or in the fields of sales or consulting, need to be influencing the external and internal stakeholders constantly, so a very focused and positive state of mind is crucial,"" degregorio tells cnn travel.

the result resembles a hotel room more than an airport cabin. courtesy singapore airlines

""rest and privacy are important during long flights as typically one does not have the luxury of time while traveling on business; privacy offers more control over the environment, the ability to prepare work more freely, and less psychological pressure in interaction.""

the singapore airlines reveal also showcased entirely new business class seats, constructed of carbon fiber composite ""similar to the kind of material you see used in formula one race cars,"" noted goh.

couples seated together are now also granted the ability to combine space and get cozy in a 78-inch-long double bed, thanks to retractable partitions and seats that recline to fully flat.

long-haul specialty

singapore airlines focuses on long-haul flights. courtesy singapore airlines

by virtue of the small size of the country -- singapore is 276 square miles, half the size of los angeles -- and with only one major international airport, it's plain to see why singapore airlines operates no domestic flights.

the shortest route on its map is a 185-mile hop from singapore to kuala lumpur, and is often packed with passengers connecting to the malaysian capital from other distant destinations.

the airline even held the world record for longest commercial flight up to 2011, when it discontinued a 19-hour nonstop from singapore to newark that it plans to resurrect later in 2018.

in other words, singapore caters for travelers on gruelingly long and involved itineraries is a specialty of singapore airlines.

similar can be said for the only other two airlines boasting of double beds onboard: etihad airways , which introduced the single-room first class ""apartment"" and three-room ""the residence"" accommodations onboard their a380 aircraft in 2014 ; and qatar airways, whose ""qsuite"" business class debuted this year on select boeing 777-300er routes from doha to london, paris, and new york.

(cnn) -- some revolutions happen in a single day; others over decades. the rise of the voluntarily single woman has been happening in western societies slowly, over time, concomitant with well-paying jobs, legal protection from economic or physical abuse, reliable birth control and the possibility of fulfilling careers and adventures.

women are marrying at a later age these days, cohabiting with their partners or going in and out of short-term relationships without ever walking down the aisle.

currently, 53% of women over 18 are in the singles column. put another way, women now have choices that allow them to customize the arc of their lives and some of them find that it is best for them to put marriage aside.

is this natural? is this bad? is this cause for alarm?

we have long counted on women's sacrifices and the compromises they've made to lift societies all over the world. we are worried that if women delay or forgo marriage, the all-important family unit will suffer.

as much as i admire happy couples and families, i think this may be one of the few times in history when so many women could choose from such a full range of life choices without penalty or stigma. since few people ""have it all,"" why not choose being single if that's the best option?

what it comes down to is people get married when it's a good deal. the question is why isn't marriage a good deal anymore? here are some considerations.

1. a useless husband

if a woman is poor and only meets equally poor or poorer men, she's in a tough spot. it is no secret that many women do not choose to marry if the available partners will make their economic situation worse.

in some of these cases, even if a woman has a child, she may be better off with government help than a nonworking, noninvolved husband.

2. success changes everything

when a woman is very privileged or highly successful, marriage could come very easily -- or not. think of the likes of elizabeth taylor, who was married eight times. or oprah winfrey, who for personal or professional reasons, is not married.

moreover, a woman doesn't need a husband who is a high-powered corporate attorney if she is a high-powered corporate attorney. taking advantage of economic and professional opportunities could be undermined by committing to a partner with an equally ambitious, or different, life agenda. this kind of woman may wake up every day to new and exciting challenges and think, ""best to wait.""

3. unwilling to make traditional compromises

a woman who doesn't want to settle for cooking and cleaning and being the primary parent that society prefers. she is not meeting guys who want the kind of woman she is.

4. the marriage penalty tax

some women are in an income bracket where marriage inflicts economic costs. she would have to pay more taxes if she marries someone who earns approximately what she makes or more.

5. avoiding cheating men

a few years ago when i was in china, i had a conversation with some very beautiful female chinese tv personalities about their personal life. i asked them why they were single and if they wanted to get married.

the three women all said they didn't want to marry because ""the men of our class will all expect to have mistresses, and it is better not to marry than have to put up with that."" i have no idea if this was an exaggeration or not -- but they believed it.

6. waiting for the ""one""

these women wait for the perfect guy, or the guy who they would fall in love with and love them back just as much. if that man doesn't come along, they prefer to go alone. as women get pickier, more factors enter into the marriage equation.

they may find someone who doesn't quite go the distance even after years of dating. they cohabit with someone and it doesn't work out. singlehood, never intentional, becomes a fact. but they will not marry just to marry as their mothers or grandmothers might have.

in social psychology, there is a classic theory called ""exchange theory."" it is a bit cold-blooded, but it predicts that a person's actions will be based on trying to find a balance of give and get. each person's resources -- of all kinds, including money, looks, background -- are traded back and forth for a ""good deal."" for example, a ""good deal"" scenario could be a woman who makes an excellent living pairing up with a man who is a writer and is willing to work at home and be the primary child care person.

when women's life choices were highly constrained, they had little negotiating power. they had to marry or were seen as damaged. a few got away with being ""free spirits"" but usually they were exceptional in wealth or lineage -- and even so, it wasn't easy.

it's different now. while most women still want marriage, they don't want it at just any price. they don't want it if it scuttles their dreams. marriage is not dead -- not by a long shot. it is still, to most of us, the house we wish to build for our love, our lover and our children.

but women want to craft a life instead of having it pressed upon them. and that means some of us will be single for a long time, and some of us will be single for life.

oshi agabi said: ""we merged synthetic neurobiology with traditional silicon technology with the goal of fixing urgent real world problems.""

silicon valley-based agabi unveiled his invention at tedglobal conference in tanzania on sunday and says it could one day revolutionize airport security, enabling travelers ""to walk from their car to the aircraft.""

""explosives have particles and smells coming off the individual and with our device you can tell, without requiring line of sight or contact, you can scan them at the time at a place of your own choosing and you can get into an aircraft and go about your business.""

koniku, which means 'immortal' in the nigerian yoruba language, started in 2015 and has already raised $8 million in revenue, according to the founder agabi.

""we believe quite strongly that it's going to be run with biological brains that are made with synthetic biological neurons. that is the declared intention of our company: to build a brain.""

then she got the phone call.

a 6-year-old girl needed a permanent home, the adoption case worker said. already the child had bounced between 10 foster homes after being removed from her original home because of abuse. she deserved a better life and a strong parent, and bierly -- who later fell for the child -- was the sort who could give her both.

she's been steeped in the adoption world for 27 years. her oldest son is adopted, and she's a family attorney who also serves as director of adoption for the academy of adoption and assisted reproduction attorneys . she understood what was at stake.

she began thinking about what a young child would mean for her finances. facing an unexpected new round of summer camps, school expenses, extracurricular activities and future college tuition bills, she took comfort knowing she would qualify for the full amount of the one-time adoption tax credit, or $13,570 per child.

""i don't know what i would have done without the credit,"" said bierly, of state college, pennsylvania. ""it was in the calculation for me, as a middle-class person practicing law,"" and it shaped her decision to meet with the adoption team.

bierly will finalize the adoption of her first daughter on december 22. if the new gop tax bill goes into effect as it reads right now, she may be getting that needed credit just under the wire.

defining 'pro-family'

house republicans unveiled a 429-page tax overhaul last week, and among the proposals in the "" tax cuts and jobs act "" is getting rid of the adoption tax credit which has been on the books for 20 years.

this means, if this bill were to pass this year as is, families that finalize adoptions starting in 2018 wouldn't have access to the credit.

the amount of the credit, as it stands right now, starts to phase out when families have an adjusted gross income above $203,540 and is off limits once that income exceeds $243,540. adoption advocates say the credit exists for families who may not be able to afford adoption otherwise.

the main architect behind the new tax bill, rep. kevin brady, is the father of two adopted children himself. but the chairman of the ways and means committee never used the adoption tax credit, a committee spokeswoman confirmed.

brady, a republican from texas, argues that the tax credit leaves families behind, especially those that don't itemize or face big tax bills. instead, he and other bill proponents point to how the reform would nearly double the standard deduction individuals and families can take. it also creates the family credit, which includes a new $300 credit for each for parent and non-child dependents, and expands the child tax credit from the current $1,000 to $1,600.

""i'm convinced that if we give tax relief to families every year -- they can use their paychecks for what matters most to them -- including adopting children,"" he said in a written statement to cnn. ""we are working to give families not only help when they're adopting but every year when that child is growing up, by making sure they have more in their paychecks to raise kids.""

bierly and others in her network say the loss of the credit will mean lost adoptions. in 2015, nearly 64,000 families used the credit to some degree. and for a bill that touts itself as being ""pro-family,"" they believe the proposed cut amounts to hypocrisy.

""there are children who have no families. what's more important than that?"" said mary boo, executive director of the north american council on adoptable children . ""we've talked to thousands of families who could not have adopted without that credit. we know it's important.""

the cost for adoptions vary, but each year adoptive families , a magazine and online resource, conducts a survey to take the pulse of what people are spending. the latest survey , looking at adoptions finalized in 2015 and 2016, showed domestic newborn adoptions cost an average of $37,000 and international adoptions averaged about $42,000. adoptions from the u.s. foster care system cost little in comparison, on average about $2,600, assuming there are no complications. and that doesn't mean parents won't incur plenty of expenses, especially when the children have special needs -- including, for example, those born with addictions.

""financial incentives do make a difference in people's decisions on whether to adopt,"" said adam pertman, president and founder of the national center on adoption and permanency . ""not that they do it for the money, but it's expensive and it makes a difference and helps people get to yes.""

bigger than politics

when talk of repealing the credit started percolating, a coalition of activists geared up to respond. they launched a movement -- "" save the adoption tax credit "" -- hoping to stamp out any further discussions.

one of the people involved in this working group is michaela sims, a washington, d.c., lobbyist and former senate staffer. she's known her way around capitol hill for 20 years and isn't easily rattled.

""nothing fazes me anymore, and i've been specifically preparing for this [proposed cut] for over a year,"" said sims, 47. ""but when i saw it in black and white, it took my breath way.""

michaela sims stewart, who goes by her maiden name professionally, thanks the adoption tax credit for allowing her and her husband jon to bring sam, left, and jack into their family.

a mother of two adopted boys, now 9 and 11, she and her husband know firsthand the importance of the tax credit. between her husband's work as a special education teaching assistant and her work on the hill when they adopted, those tax credits made all the difference.

the issue, she points out, is bipartisan and bigger than politics. even some of the most conservative voices out there are weighing in with their outrage.

the united states conference of catholic bishops issued a statement monday, calling the credit ""life-affirming assistance"" and ""vital as a pro-life concern.""

the president of focus on the family, jim daly, also entered the mix.

""more than 60 percent of adopted children in the u.s. are adopted by middle- and lower-income taxpayers,"" he wrote in a blog post last week. ""almost one-half of children adopted from foster care live in families with household incomes under $75,000. ... eliminating [the tax credit] is unacceptable. we can do better as a nation.""

lost adoptions hurt more than children and the families who want them; society also pays a price, daly and other advocates say.

children in foster care who age out of the system, meaning they reach 18 without being adopted, are less likely to be positive contributors, according to numbers culled by the national council for adoption . only 6% graduate from college, 25% don't get a high school degree or ged and only 48% are employed. half have substance abuse problems, 40% spend time homeless, and of the young men who age out, 60% have been convicted of a crime.

furthermore, every child that's adopted saves the government $127,000 in long-term foster care costs, says schylar baber, executive director of voice for adoption , which works on behalf of the 112,000 children awaiting adoption in the foster care system.

the issue of a family getting a tax credit, however, ""is much broader than dollars and cents,"" he said. ""it's about a child and the life of a child.""

'chasing a carrot'

kendra and mike taylor, who live outside nashville, have spent years determined to give children a chance.

they married nine years ago and, as devout mormons, have always believed having a family was part of heavenly father's plan. for years, they've tried to have children to no avail. they've grappled with the pain of not walking the path they imagined and found comfort in their faith. god has something else in mind for them: adoption.

kendra and mike taylor are hoping to adopt siblings from foster care.

for a year and a half, they've been on a journey to adopt siblings from foster care. they've seen on the adoption websites how siblings separate, how the oldest children often get left behind, and their hearts couldn't take it.

""we decided to go with harder-to-adopt kids and to give them the love and stability that everyone deserves,"" said kendra, 30, a part-time gymnastics coach. ""just because they've had a rough start doesn't mean it has to be that way for the rest of their lives.""

they've been preparing themselves to ""bring in three or four kids at once,"" said mike, 32, a branch manager for a pest control company. ""if you have that ability, it feels like a moral obligation.""

the home study process is complete. they've filled out piles of paperwork, undergone physicals and collected recommendations. they've participated in special trainings, over the course of weeks, to help them deal with the sorts of traumas often experienced by foster children. and they've spent about $8,000 already, between the private company they hired to do their home study, the inspections they had done of their home and the trainings. finally they are in the phase where they can look for a match.

then this new tax bill came along to potentially derail their efforts. even if they found their match tomorrow, it would take six months to finalize the adoptions. the legal fees that await them could vary, depending on the state where the siblings live, how many children are in the group and whether or not parental rights are severed. the taylors estimate they could face charges of anywhere from $4,000 to $12,000 per child. if the tax credit incentive disappears before they finalize anything, it would put their plans to have a family on hold.

""if you have a child naturally and in the hospital, you have health insurance to cover the bills,"" kendra said. ""nothing covers the legal fees for adoption. you're on the hook for it.""

the adoption tax credit has offered some solace. the idea of waiting years to save up or having to take a second mortgage out on their home so they can have a family leaves them frustrated.

jonathan cristol

trump managed not to insult south korean president moon jae-in or the korean people. more importantly, he did not directly threaten nuclear war with north korea or threaten to withdraw us forces from the korean peninsula.

he reaffirmed the us-south korean alliance, albeit without the standard ""ironclad"" language, and he said, ""i know that the republic of korea, which has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a faithful ally of the united states very long into the future,"" without saying that the reverse would also be true. so, measured by the admittedly low standard of not saying something that might trigger war and risk millions of lives, the speech was one of trump's best.

the bad news is that trump did not articulate a new strategy for dealing with north korea. he articulated a willingness to talk to north korea, which is good, but he continued his insistence on denuclearization as a precondition for talks -- ""we are only prepared to discuss this brighter path for north korea if its leaders cease their threats and dismantle their nuclear program"" -- which is not so much bad as it is pointless. north korea will never denuclearize, and insisting on denuclearization as a precondition to talks is tantamount to saying there will be no talks.

wandering about the capital of vietnam , travelers expecting a wild urban adventure might be pleasantly surprised to also find quiet, leafy streets and hidden coffee shops.

one of the most charming aspects of the city is the plethora of restored neoclassical and gothic architecture -- a holdover from the city's stint as a french colony from 1883 to 1954.

it's easy to romanticize the era, given the beautiful remains, but it's worth remembering that this was a difficult time for hanoi, afflicted with opium addictions and oppression.

despite the turbulent history, the resulting architecture is worth admiring. one way to experience it is with a stay at one of the city's many boutique hotels.

located in hanoi's old quarter -- a network of 36 streets, organized by trade -- these quaint addresses combine modern amenities with historic atmosphere for an authentic homebase while exploring the city. here are eight of the best:

1. hotel de l'opera

as its name suggests, hotel de l'opera is just a few steps from the beautiful hanoi opera house, which regularly hosts ballet, music and folk performances.

the largest of its kind in vietnam, the theater features a neo-classical french facade, imposing pillars and majestic interiors.

on the same leafy boulevard, the 107-room hotel de l'opera is set in its own white colonial-era building.

inside the stately doors, guests will find high ceilings, silk drapes, classic furniture, theatrical pops of color and big-name designer boutiques downstairs -- think max mara, prada and louis vuitton.

each room has a slightly different layout and design. rest assured, however, that all four l'opera grand suites offer views of the opera house.

within minutes of leaving the hotel, guests will discover the city's central lake, bustling old quarter and countless bars and restaurants.

a new address in hanoi, la siesta central hotel & spa opened earlier this august in the historic old quarter, near photogenic hoan kiem lake.

the 27-bedroom property showcases lake views from 19 of its rooms, and also features a fine-dining restaurant, a sunset rooftop bar and a spa that emphasizes vietnamese therapies.

the building itself is newly constructed in the colonial style. inside, the hotel pays tribute to the city's french heritage -- picture dark-wood paneling, black-and-white patterned tiles, wrought-iron furniture, romantic balconies and classic monochrome artwork peppering the hallways.

with the old quarter just steps away and the peaceful lake at your doorstep, this is one of the best locations in hanoi.

3. o'gallery premier hotel

conveniently located inside hanoi's old quarter, the o'gallery premier hotel can be spotted by its narrow, colonial-style facade awash in green paint.

taking photos of everyday north korea is often considered a risky endeavor, if not tantamount to espionage. but for british filmmaker matt hulse, all it required was a cheap chinese phone, a clip-on lens and a room with a view.

shot from a hotel balcony during three trips to pyongyang, his eerie, voyeuristic images show some of the city's residents going about their daily lives. the pictures form part of ""sniper,"" an asia-wide photo series that was chosen from over 2,000 entries to win a felix schoeller photo award.

but hulse, who lives in beijing and regularly travels to north korea as a tour guide, says that he didn't break any rules capturing the shots -- despite the well-documented restrictions facing foreign visitors to the country.

""there's nothing stopping people taking photos from their hotel windows,"" he said in a phone interview. ""and if they had seen me, they would just have thought, 'there's a guy with a phone taking photos of the beautiful city.'

""if one of the guides had asked to see the pictures, they would have been more bemused than anything. they'd probably say, 'why are you taking pictures of a bus driver when he's not even looking at the camera?' they wouldn't understand the art photography angle of it at all.""

a 'sinister' aesthetic

resembling the view through a sniper rifle's scope, the photos' distinct aesthetic was produced using a detachable telescopic lens. bought for less than $10 and affixed to a ""not particularly brilliant"" phone, the device flattened the perspective of hulse's photos and created their distinct circular frames.

""it could just be a driver or a guard having a cigarette or something,"" he said. ""but because of the way the photos look, and the angle they're shot at, they have a certain voyeuristic, sinister quality to them.""

despite this, the series is intended to display ""a certain kind of humor."" while hulse found snooping on people ""slightly uncomfortable,"" the normality of the scenes depicted offer a new perspective on a notoriously secretive society.

the ""sniper"" collection includes similar photos taken in hong kong and mongolia. they too capture unaware subjects shot from high vantage points. but hulse readily admits that people's fascination with north korea adds a certain mystique to the pyongyang images.

""there's nothing really going on (in the photos) other than what's in the viewer's mind,"" he said. ""if you didn't know it was north korea, it would have a different impact. but north korea is, as ever, of great fascination to the media. everyone who comes to the photographs is bringing a whole load of (their own) references and associations.

""the way that the photos look suggests that there must be something else going on -- and that's the art of it. you might see the pictures and think they have nice texture or composition, but it's all the other information that makes them richer.""

mount ashland, oregon (cnn) he was an old man who spent his days alone in the mountains of southern oregon looking for a bee. he hadn't seen the bee -- no one had seen this particular bee species -- in 10 years when he asked me to join him.

it was august, the last breath of summer bee season. robbin thorp, then 82, a retired entomologist from university of california-davis, wore a safari hat, tinted bifocals and a t-shirt with an image of franklin's bumblebee printed on the chest. that black-and-yellow bee, which looks like so many others except for the characteristic ""u"" on its back, is the object of thorp's obsession. it's a creature he told me flies through his dreams, always just out of reach.

finding it -- believing it can be found -- is what brings him to this spot 6,400 feet above sea level, near the base of a ski lift, even though his gait is wobbly now and these craggy, alpine ravines could break a 20-something hip.

franklin's bumblebee is a species other scientists fear extinct. but thorp will barely entertain that idea.

""when things are rare, they're really, really hard to find,"" he told me.

thorp can be matter of fact like that.

and so the old man keeps looking, bee net in one hand and ""bee vacuum"" in the other. he walks from one flower to the next, inspecting the pollinators. if he sees one that might be franklin's he'll slurp it into the bee vacuum, which looks like a child's water gun. then he closely inspects it: ""just another one of the common bumblebees.""

he does this on his own time and for no pay, usually alone.

day after day, year after year.

it's almost like something out of hemingway: the old man and the bee.

i'll admit that when i met thorp on august 8, 2016, the day before the 10-year anniversary of his last sighting of franklin's bumblebee, which occurred on that very slope, i had my doubts about his quest. to me, the bee hunt seemed like a sisyphean task. that's because scientists say we are entering a new age of mass extinction. species are disappearing at something like 100 times the normal rate, and biologists fear three-quarters of all species could disappear in the next couple centuries if we don't stop polluting the atmosphere and bulldozing habitat.

in that context, it's hard not to see thorp as an old man living in an old world, one where a species reasonably can be expected to survive one year to the next.

we don't live in that world anymore.

but after two days with thorp i realized that he's on to something.

it's precisely when we stop looking for species that we allow them to vanish.

'woahdude'

i'm sure by now you've read something about bees being in trouble. maybe you've heard of ""colony collapse disorder,"" or perhaps there's a do-gooder on your facebook page who is raising a beehive in her yard and takes way too many selfies in a space-age suit.

all of that barely scratches the surface of the trouble bees face.

there are roughly 20,000 species of bees in the world -- that's more than birds or amphibians or reptiles or mammals -- and the western honey bee, the one you usually hear about, the one that lives in big, social hives and is domesticated to produce honey -- is just one of those species.

to get a sense of what the other 19,999 are like, it helps to talk to sam droege, a researcher at the us geological survey's bee inventory and monitoring lab in maryland. droege spends his days taking super-high-resolution photos of dead bee specimens, some of which come from natural history museums and others that are pulled from field research. one benefit of the work is that it provides a detailed catalog of species, in case they disappear.

but the photos are also just really freaking cool -- in that way potheads can appreciate. some of the images first got popular on a stoner-themed subpage of the website reddit. the page is called ""woahdude."" droege's daughter brought that to his attention, ""why was my daughter looking at the stoner subreddit, i don't know!,"" he told a documentary film crew

take a look at a few of the images:

we're losing this diversity fast.

so that's the stoner argument for why bees matter.

here's the self-interested one: bees help pollinate 35% of the world's food, and bumblebees, of which franklin's bumblebee is (or was) one, pollinate everything from tomatoes to cranberries and blueberries and melons. yet they live in underground colonies, caring for a queen. and they don't make honey, so you don't hear as much about them from journalists.

sarina jepsen, deputy chair of the international union for conservation of nature's bumblebee specialist group, and a director at the xerces society, an environmental nonprofit, told me about 25% of bumblebees in north america are at risk for extinction. ""if you think about it, that's a really strikingly high percentage of a fauna to be declining -- and in some cases really crashing,"" said leif richardson, a postdoctoral fellow at the gund institute for ecological economics.

and much of the vanishing is undocumented.

""it's abysmal what we know right now,"" droege, from usgs, told me.

""there are just too few people on the ground looking.""

'it was just gone'

robbin thorp started looking for franklin's bumblebee in the 1960s. he'd taken an entomology course at the university of michigan and got hooked on the invisible insect world. it's an obsession that was, from the start, both personal and professional. he told me his first wife did not love the fact that he kept stacks of insect eggs and other specimens in their apartment.

""she was not a naturalist,"" he said, laughing. ""but she put up with it.""

in 1998, he began to study franklin's bumblebee in earnest.

in part, he was interested in whether the bee should be listed under the endangered species act. but he also just wanted to know what this bee was all about. why did it live only in northern california and southern oregon when so many other bee species had wider ranges? which flowers did it prefer? which plants and potentially crops would be lost without it?

back then, the bee was relatively abundant -- not the most common, but far from the least. ""i could walk down and see (franklin's bumblebee) on every patch of flowers,"" he told me.

""i'd see 15, 20 of 'em in just a short distance.""

a year or two later, the bee became more difficult to find.

then all of a sudden: ""it was just gone.""

thorp's work shifted from what-is-this-bee-up-to to where-the-hell-did-it-go. the bee scientist, in a sense, became a detective. who or what could have killed franklin's bumblebee?

thorp hoped finding it might offer some clues.

'there's something flying!'

i met thorp on a cool, clear morning in the parking lot at the base of oregon's mount ashland ski area. you could see california's mount shasta from this altitude. i worry about meeting people for the first time -- whether i'll know who they are and all that. but identifying thorp was no trouble at all. white truck, bumblebee sticker on tailgate. yep, that's him.

his treasured bee, however, proved much harder to pick out of a crowd.

we drove 15 minutes or so down a gravel road toward the meadow where thorp last spotted franklin's bumblebee, on august 9, 2006, a date he recites from memory. when we stopped, thorp pulled a little wooden box out of the back of his pickup and opened it.

inside, rows of dead bees with pins stuck through them.

""these are franklin's,"" he said, pointing to three of them. ""a queen, a worker and a male.""

shaky handwriting dated the specimens: ""1950.""

the trouble: franklin's bee looked like so many others in the box. thorp told me franklin's is distinguished by its ""round black face"" -- ""some of the others have a very long face,"" he said -- and by a u-shaped black marking on its back, near the wings. ""you're going to be seeing a lot of these,"" thorp said, pointing to the yellow-faced bumblebee, which, true to name, has a yellow face (as does franklin's) and a distinguishing yellow stripe on its abdomen.

none of this helped me much. i drew a few pictures in my notebook -- jotted down these descriptions and pretended i could tell all of these seemingly identical bees apart.

""there's something flying!"" thorp said, pointing to a bee that buzzed right by my leg.

""it's probably headed for the flowers.""

apparently, so were we.

'that's a fly'

to find bees, thorp told me, you start with the flowers.

if you know something about bumblebees and what they're up to -- i didn't, thorp did -- this makes sense. bumblebees serve a queen, which is buried in a den beneath the ground. worker bees -- females that don't reproduce because they're not the queen -- fly around during the day collecting flower pollen and nectar for food and energy.

they carry the pollen back to the nest in saddle bags, which look like little orange or yellow (it depends on the pollen) footballs taped to their legs. i asked thorp if this was the origin of the phrase ""the bee's knees."" sorry to report: it's not. he did tell me, however, that all of these bumblebees, except the queen, die each year. the queen hibernates through the winter alone, producing the next year's generation.

it's a risky life cycle, and it's one reason thorp is so concerned about franklin's, which, by the way, is named for a researcher, not benjamin franklin.

another fun bumblebee fact: females sting, males don't.

to prove the point, thorp slurped a male from the air with his bee vacuum --

zeeeeeeeep!

-- and put the poor guy in my hand.

""it's kind of like a cell phone on buzz mode,"" he said.

that's exactly how it felt.

that buzz -- which is much stronger on a bumblebee than other bees -- is what shakes pollen off of flowers, helping them reproduce. bumblebees pollinate crops other bees can't.

some bees have evolved to pollinate very-specific plants. franklin's bumblebee can pollinate many things, thorp told me, but it tends to prefer two plants: a mini-mum-looking flower called yellow buckwheat; and a purplish blossom commonly called coyote mint, but which thorp calls ""monardella."" we set our sights on those flowers and continued scanning the field.

the trouble: these flowers were everywhere.

notebook in hand, i started testing my bee-id skills.

i pointed at a bee i thought, stupidly, might be franklin's.

""this also has a yellow face but it's shaggier looking,"" he said.

i'd never thought of bees as ""shaggy"" before.

""which one is that?"" i asked.

""that's a fly.""

500 million butterflies

the precise location where thorp saw franklin's bumblebee in 2006 is on a steep slope, past a clump of trees and slightly below the pacific crest trail, the famous hiking path.

unlike me, thorp can identify bees in a split second. he knew instantly that this was franklin's bumblebee, which he hadn't seen in three years at that point. he saw it zip down the meadow, across what now is a field of yellow buckwheat, and toward a soggy ravine.

thorp was 72 then.

still, he ran downhill after the bee.

he never caught it.

and he remains mystified by its disappearance.

that's because the usual bee killers don't make total sense for franklin's.

there are a number of reasons for the crash of pollinators bees worldwide. mainly, they are habitat loss ( nearly 40% of all land is used for agriculture , according to the food and agriculture organization), climate change (the land that's left is changing, and this is shrinking the ranges of some bees) and rampant chemical use.

you may remember seeing images of millions of dead bees in south carolina earlier this year. officials sprayed insecticide in hopes of killing mosquitoes that could transmit the zika virus. millions of honeybees became unintended casualties. more pervasive, though, are pesticides and herbicides, which are routinely sprayed on crops like corn. more than 500 million monarch butterflies have disappeared since 1997 , according to the center for biological diversity. that's partly because herbicide use has killed off much of their habitat, the group says, noting that a texas sized chunk of monarch habitat has been lost in the last 20 years.

some researchers fear their epic migration is in jeopardy.

franklin's bumblebee, meanwhile, seems to live on a pristine, alpine meadow, with few people around and no crops that i saw. its historic range only includes california and oregon. climate change is mangling so many things in the natural world it's difficult to tease out its effect everywhere -- but thorp suspected a totally different culprit.

to understand it, you need to take a quick trip with me.

'caution: bumblebees at work'

there's a shiny pool of disinfectant by the door to the greenhouse at windset farms in british columbia, about 600 miles up the pacific coast from mount ashland.

two ominous signs are stuck to the door.

""warning: strict biosecurity measures in effect.""

""caution: bumblebees at work.""

i got a tour from ron moes, a senior grower at windset, which grows tomatoes and a host of other crops in greenhouses that seem big enough to contain neighborhoods.

i was interested in the farm because it hires commercial bees -- raised in factories some 2,000 miles away and then flown way out here.

""when we get the bees, they come in a box like this,"" moes told me, pointing to what looked to be a box for legal files. except that it had a bunch of bees buzzing around inside.

""when i started, we pollinated everything by hand,"" he said. ""we manually went around with the -- we call it a vibrator -- and we would touch every flower and pollinate."" now that the greenhouse has hired commercial bees, an industry that developed in the late 1990s, the process is more efficient and cheaper. ""they're great workers,"" moes said. ""they put in a lot of time. they basically go from sunup to sunset, and they basically work seven days a week.""

aside from the postapocalyptic feel of the place -- the bees are raised only for mass production and their colonies are incinerated after eight weeks of work -- perhaps there is nothing wrong with hiring bees for their pollination services. they can pollinate better than a ""vibrator"" -- so let them do their thing, right? but thorp and other researchers are concerned about diseases that can spread anytime you have a bunch of homogenous livestock -- or bees -- in one place.

thorp fears greenhouse diseases, perhaps one called nosema, infected wild bee populations -- and helped lead to the rapid decline of franklin's bumblebee.

moes told me windset takes ample precautions to prevent that sort of thing from happening. aside from incinerating the hives, they trap queen bees inside the boxes permanently so that she can't start new colonies. the greenhouse is disinfected regularly, he said.

still, there are open panels in the ceiling of the greenhouse. and while moes told me these bees have no interest in leaving so many pollination-ready tomato crops, it does seem possible one or two could sneak out. it's enough of a concern that conservationists like jepsen, at the xerces society in portland, want stiffer, disease-minded regulation of the commercial bee industry. she also wants commercial bees to only be local species, instead of shipped around the globe.

'what's the value of this?'

whatever the cause, thorp is understandably alarmed by franklin's bumblebee's disappearance. and he's sure humans are behind it somehow.

as i walked up and down the meadows of oregon with thorp looking for this impossible-to-find insect, i thought about how we know so very little about the natural world. we live in concrete cities, deal only with managed forms of nature -- farms, lawns, medians.

in a generation or two, will there be any robbin thorps left?

will anyone notice species like franklin's are disappearing?

maybe it seems like this doesn't matter -- it's just one bee. others will pick up the slack of pollinating wildflowers, and we have factory bees to pollinate fruits and vegetables now.

to that, i'd offer two arguments.

one is that farmers in part of china now have to pollinate apple crops by hand because wild bee populations have vanished entirely. true, the crop isn't gone. but what does that say about us?

for the second, i'll give the floor to thorp.

i asked him to name the question about franklin's that bothers him most.

""i guess the question that irks me the most is, 'what's the value of this?'""

meaning, what's the economic value of this species.

he hates that question because, yes, pollination services from nature are valued at billions per year, and, yes, the grocery store would look much sadder without bees and other pollinators.

but that's missing the bigger truth.

""i don't think you can put an economic value on a species,"" he told me, sitting in that meadow in oregon he's returned to so many times since 2006. ""to me they're all valuable. they're all priceless really ... franklin's is one that i've had a lot of personal investment in, in many ways. and, yeah, i feel an attachment and kinship to it.""

can you imagine what the world would be like if we all thought that way?

we might not be on the verge of the sixth mass extinction in earth's history -- something of dinosaur-ending magnitude. anthony barnosky, an expert on this from stanford university, told me humans have about 20 years max to shape up before this mass extinction becomes inevitable. and by mass extinction he means three-quarters of all known species would be lost.

franklin's bumblebee should be a wake-up call -- a window into a dystopian future.

it certainly was for me.

'honeybee on buckwheat'

i wasted the first day-and-a-half i spent with thorp wondering what keeps this old man looking for this lost bee. it must be extinct, i thought. give up.

but then, somehow, i got hooked on this quest.

the more i looked for franklin's bumblebee, the more i learned about this meadow in oregon, the rich lattice of flowers, bees, ferns and the like that make it wonderful and unique. and the more i learned the more i wanted to believe that franklin's bumblebee might still be out there -- somewhere, against all odds.

i know that probably sounds silly, but thorp's endless vat of hope is infectious. if we're going to beat the sixth extinction, we have to believe it's possible. we need to believe species like franklin's bumblebee matter.

we should be pissed off they're missing.

late in the afternoon, i left thorp and walked off on my own path.

thorp mutters notes into a voice recorder while he walks through the mountains looking for bees -- listing the flowers and the insects. i decided to try the same, speaking notes to my phone.

""honeybee on buckwheat. yellow-faced whatever on buckwheat.""

""there's a big patch of this mint stuff that franklin's bumblebee likes. it's kinda purple. yellow faced bumblebee -- looks like -- just flew up. it's buzzing one of those flowers. i guess it's good there are bees here at all, but these are not the bees i'm looking for.""

""there's just this buzzing sound all around you. it kinda makes you insane.""

i got so into it that i actually started talking to the bees.

""do you guys know where franklin is?""

we never found it.

i was crushed.

thorp was disappointed but hopeful.

and as long as he can walk, he told me, he will continue the search. THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Los Angeles",the old man and the bee

THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Chicago","(cnn) vampires were the most popular undead creatures for over a century, far outshining zombies, mummies, frankenstein monsters and all other dwellers of that liminal space between life and death.

but what good is halloween if we don't take annual stock of our views on animated corpses? (the irony you hear in my voice is not just your imagination.) it is time to admit that the age of the vampire has been eclipsed and given way to the age of the zombie.

consider this undeniable phenomenon: from its beginnings, the zombie film and television drama has been at the forefront of racial boundary-breaking. this progressiveness is a function of good storytelling, not a liberal political agenda.

in a post-apocalyptic scenario brought on by a highly contagious zombie virus, survival skills are the currency of the realm. racial stereotyping would be clunky for the plot. there's no time to compare pedigrees when the involuntary loss of your frontal lobe is at stake.

while the zombie genre has been said to have a fraught history with race , it's also been a vehicle for breaking down racial boundaries. the mother of all zombie films, george romero's 1968 cult classic ""night of the living dead,"" featured one of the first african-american action heroes in the history of cinema, in the role of ben (played by duane jones, who was a theater director in the state university of new york system).

the sole person of color trapped in a house with hysterical white strangers, ben alone remains cool-headed. he boards up the windows, seeks medical help for an injured girl and is generally the sole rational decision-maker. remarkably, no mention is made of his blackness. the one time his tactics are challenged -- with no mention of race -- he says calmly, ""now get the hell down in the cellar. you can be the boss down there, i'm boss up here!"" that is the end of the matter.

whereas the zombie genre has only been popular for the last five decades or so, vampires had a long head start, having benefited from an unbeatable pr machine. starting with bram stoker's dracula and culminating in the ""twilight"" franchise, vampires have been depicted as aristocratic and wealthy -- immortality is expensive, after all. they are multilingual and acquire all manner of degrees and skills you'd expect from those with a lot of free time. they are intensely erotic and driven by the credo that love is literally eternal.

zombies, by contrast, are walking putrefaction. no one wants to have sex with them. they are unhygienic and ill-mannered. vampires at least have the decency not to enter a home uninvited, while zombies from time immemorial have loved nothing better than to shove their arms through boarded-up windows.

but in recent years, public interest has shifted toward the smelly, unmanicured zombie. in 2009, the year before amc's zombie series ""the walking dead"" premiered, there were no episodic television series about zombies. now, there are no fewer than eight such series -- ""the walking dead"" (which just broadcast its 100th episode), ""fear of the walking dead,"" ""izombie,"" ""z nation,"" ""ash v. evil dead,"" ""santa clarita diet,"" ""let the right one in"" and ""feel the dead."" (the latter two shows are set to premiere in the coming months.)

just watched campers learn to survive zombie attack replay more videos ... must watch campers learn to survive zombie attack 01:59

actually, there are nine zombie shows if you include ""game of thrones,"" since we now know that the real threat (spoiler alert) is not being conquered, but being turned into a zombie -- or the fear that the white walkers will turn all humans into members of their undead army.

so, why are we more riveted than ever by these unsympathetic creatures who have lost their minds, autonomy and ability to love?

one reason that leaps to mind is that for some who feel disenfranchised, the zombie's fate has become increasingly relatable. this first became apparent in october 2011, when a group of occupy wall street protesters started dressing as zombies to make the point that the ruling 1% was stealing everyone's autonomy. that same year, viewership for amc's ""the walking dead"" grew by 32% compared to the previous season: season 2 had an average audience of 6.91 million viewers per episode, versus 5.23 million an episode for season 1.

one of the most popular characters in ""the walking dead"" was that of glenn rhee, a korean-american (played by steven yeun, also korean-american). glenn's storyline was closely followed by every korean-american i know. in october 2015, when a friend of mine mysteriously wrote on facebook ""f- you, walking dead, i'm done,"" i knew without having seen the show that something had happened to glenn.

as with the character ben from the aforementioned ""night of the walking dead,"" glenn's ethnicity is not a punch line. nor is it a precursor to explaining an adeptness at martial arts. glenn is simply a former pizza delivery boy with excellent survival skills. and in the true meritocracy that is the zombie-plagued world, his skills are king.

the height of zombie popularity comes at a time when the movement to increase diversity in film is more vocal than ever, giving rise to hashtags like #starringjohncho - - a series of photoshopped images that imagined a world in which the korean-american actor could be cast as a romantic or heroic lead in a major hollywood film. in 2016, #makemulanright arose from reports of an allegedly leaked disney script for the live-action version of mulan, which may have featured a white sailor as its male protagonist.

and in recent years, there has been increasing public furor over whitewashing in hollywood casting, with asian-americans threatening film boycotts over the matter of asian roles being given to actors like emma stone, tilda swinton and ed skrein. the latter ultimately bowed out of a role in the upcoming film ""hellboy,"" so that the asian character could be played by an asian actor. the role eventually went to the korean-american actor daniel dae kim.

zombies tap into very contemporary fears among people of color. it's not for nothing the widely-circulated "" black people's guide to game of thrones ,"" published online at the root, compares the white walker invasion to the rise of white supremacy.

vampire stories are still very popular, but vampires possess certain qualities that are rather unappealing for a woke world. some vampires attained undead status voluntarily, because they are unable to accept their mortality. they made a faustian bargain.

to become a vampire is to insist on privilege at the expense of others. they suffer no consequences for hurting their bodies, so they are impervious to the dangers of drug abuse or unprotected sex. they are sociopaths. narcissists. they are inherently supremacists. they think they are better than everyone else.

meanwhile, no one -- but no one -- wants to be a zombie. anyone can fall victim to the zombie virus. anyone, regardless of race or background, can become a zombie. and anyone, regardless of race or background, can become a zombie slayer.

any parent of a tween or teen can probably relate to what simms is going through.

in the ninth installment of our cnn digital video series ""parent acts,"" we asked parents to act out how their kids might demonstrate how they are wrong about everything. we then had a parenting expert listen to their role-play and weigh in with advice.

parenting strategist and licensed family therapist tricia ferrara listened to simms and said that instead of focusing on whether she is right or wrong, she should ""pull the lens back"" a bit and focus on what's happening with her daughter.

family therapist tricia ferrara is author of ""parenting 2.0.""

""what she's developing is a communication habit of unsolicited opinion,"" ferrara told simms. she offered this approach to use: ""instead of it being about whether you are right or wrong, almost like i can't do anything right or say anything right for my daughter, it's about, 'you know what, honey, let's have a time out, ok? if i asked your opinion of my answer, i would want to hear it.' ""

ferrara, the author of ""parenting 2.0: think in the future, act in the now,"" a guidebook for parents with step-by-step advice on how to strengthen their relationships with their children, said simms could also build in an incentive for the good behavior: if her daughter wants to do a sleepover at a friend's house, for instance, she needs to go 10 days without making a comment about something her mother says unless her mother asks for her opinion.

""occasionally, i would ask them their opinion and say, 'what do you think of that?' so they have an understanding it's not that you don't want to hear from them, but there is a time and a place.""

what also plays a role in how our kids respond to us, said ferrara, herself a mom of two teenagers, is how we respond as parents.

""i see a lot of parents just barking on their kids or barking on their business,"" she said. ""and so that they think it's ok to do that in reverse.""

having a child who thinks you are wrong all the time is very common, said pediatrician and author dr. claudia gold, who is an infant mental health specialist. ""depending on the degree, it's a normal developmental phenomenon.""

before adolescence, it may be happening because the child's group of friends is beginning to take prominence over the family, said gold, author of ""keeping your child in mind"" and ""the silenced child."" during adolescence, it may be related to the teen's desire to separate from their family and forge their own identify.

""when they get older and they have more advanced cognitive skills and are capable of abstract thinking, it's a kind of practicing of their own newfound abilities,"" gold said.

her advice is for parents to brush it off and not butt heads with their kids. the irritating behavior will probably go away, she said.

what needs to be looked at a bit more closely is when the child's thinking that everything their parents do or say is wrong is causing problems in a family and when the behavior really seems to be pushing the parent's buttons, said gold.

""so if it's happening a lot and people are really troubled by it, it really warrants a closer look and a little bit of time and attention to figure out the deeper story,"" she said.

it may come from a place where the parent is not feeling heard at work or in their marriage, and so when they don't feel heard by their children, they're primed to jump at that behavior, she said. it may also stem from their relationship with their own parents when they were younger or other troubled relationships in their past.

as is now customary with the passing of public figures, social media exploded with condolences for the family of the late mayor rob ford on tuesday, making it clear that a man once the subject of merciless ridicule was now being afforded a level of sympathy and kindness unfathomable just a few short years ago.

across the internet and media, punchlines have largely been replaced by dignified tributes, and crude caricatures by staid, objective reporting. why? because rob ford, alive as an alcoholic, was apparently less deserving of compassion and understanding than rob ford, now dead from cancer.

true, the fond remembrances and generous consolations are heartening, refreshing expressions of decency towards a family in grieving, and yes, they should be acknowledged and welcomed as such. to be clear, however, they are also the indisputable byproduct of the type of image makeover nobody wants — a cancer diagnosis.

fueling ford's trajectory from viciously mocked to politely mourned, his cancer demonstrated how malleable our emotional responses are in light of our moralizations. rob ford was, after all, a man who suffered from two life-threatening diseases but garnered sympathy for only one. perhaps that dichotomy is worth us, as a society, examining.

when i first wrote about ford for cnn in 2013 , i hoped to make the point that he wasn't that different from many people all around you — outwardly successful while secretly buckling under the weight of alcohol or drugs — and that addiction is a nondiscriminatory predator that strikes everywhere. but despite addiction's widespread presence and nonbiased grasp, a significant majority of society still doesn't view it — or react to it — the way we do other, less stigmatized diseases that makes us want to reach out and support the sufferer.

in fact, it wasn't until ford was diagnosed with what is unequivocally accepted as a ""real"" disease that many were able to accept, forgive and even admire him for his fight to survive. sadly for the hundreds of thousands of people who die from the disease of addiction every year, such acceptance and forgiveness never comes.

in a study published the year after rob ford first made international headlines for his struggles with drugs and alcohol, researchers from johns hopkins found that 90% of people would not want someone with addiction to marry into their family, and 78% did not want to work alongside addicted people.

furthermore, survey respondents were more willing to accept discriminatory practices against persons with drug addiction, more skeptical about the effectiveness of treatments, and more likely to oppose policies aimed at helping them. it is impossible to even conceive of similar statistics for cancer, diabetes, or heart disease, and you won't see ""saturday night live"" doing a sendup of a politician's copd or epilepsy symptoms anytime soon.

why is it that we continue to deride sufferers of one disease and openly project benevolence and humanity towards victims of another? is emotional parity for diseases truly beyond our capacity, even between two that are felling ourselves and neighbors at a frequency and volume that leaves no life untouched?

despite the fact that excessive drinking is responsible for one in 10 deaths among working-aged americans, or that drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in the united states, we rarely see the type of outward support for, and rallying around, people struggling with addiction as we do other illnesses.

families are often times left to shoulder their emotional burden alone in shame and silence, an injustice made final when underlying causes of death are cloaked behind less scrutiny-inviting terms like ""liver failure,"" or ""heart disease.""

although even many forms of cancer itself are caused by heavy drinking, you're unlikely to see blameworthy ""alcoholism"" listed in the obituary of a throat cancer victim. after all, few families left behind would choose to diminish sympathy and invite judgment for their deceased loved one. but is a forced choice between honesty and sympathy really the best we can do?

in the absence of available proof to the contrary, i'll make the assumption that rob ford would have been extended at least some level of eulogistic courtesy had his other disease taken his life. at least that's what i'll hope. but what we can't overlook is how compassion and empathy were scarce commodities during his high-profile battle with addiction, and how they shouldn't have been.

addiction is a sadly pervasive struggle in our world, present in your neighborhood and mine. the rob fords of the world are all around us, and they shouldn't have to die of cancer before we can view them humanely, on social media or otherwise.

groups of friends chink glasses of arak, an aniseed liqueur, and pore over the mezze menu. waiters -- one sporting trousers printed with bob marley's face -- deliver orders to sun-seekers, who lounge on plastic chairs propped in the sand. offshore, lucky snorkelers spot the sea turtles that swim here.

this picturesque summer scene could easily be mistaken for popular holiday hotspots such as greece or western turkey. but this is tyre, in lebanon, 80 km (50 miles) south of the capital, beirut, and 16 miles straight up the coast from the closed border with israel.

the city has a long history -- and in 2017 it breaks stereotypes that paint lebanon as a chaotic nation constantly on the brink of conflict.

""there is no one that comes to tyre and doesn't like it, or its atmosphere, or the people who live here,"" ahmed fundi, a city resident, tells cnn. ""in the summer, there are lots of parties and the atmosphere is great. every summer is better than previous ones.""

queen of the seas

tyre is lebanon's fourth largest city and is sometimes referred to as ""queen of the seas.""

behind the city's port, narrow streets are lined with houses painted violet purple and periwinkle blue. shops are full of fishing paraphernalia -- ropes, replacement hooks, and the like.

in the al-fanar bar and restaurant, on a wooden platform overhanging the sea, customers in beach cover-ups and swimming shorts drink the local beer, almaza, and dine on fish and chips, lebanese-style -- grilled with tartare sauce, lemon and slices of tomato.

founded more than 4,000 years ago, tyre prospered as one of the main cities of phoenicia, an ancient semitic civilization.

it grew rich through trade of a vibrant purple dye made from locally harvested murex shells, and formed colonies that remain as cities today: cadiz in spain and carthage in tunisia.

when the romans took tyre -- also known as sur -- in 64 bc, they built a splendid triumphal arch and one of the world's largest hippodromes.

scratch marks on the stone, supposedly where chariot riders took a bend too closely, are still visible.

these ruins, along with another complex , al mina, a kilometer or so away, comprise one of lebanon's five unesco world heritage sites.

""here we have some of the world's largest and most important roman ruins in the world,"" jalal, one of the site keepers who only wants to give his first name, tells cnn proudly.

pointing to a large map of tyre, he gestures to show that there are more ancient ruins lying underneath areas of the city covered by modern construction.

""we get visitors from france, belgium, holland, the uk -- everywhere,"" says jalal (as he speaks, some scandinavians leave the site). ""they say: 'if only there could be more archeological excavations here.' we would make the two sites one, and it would be an enormous site.""

an emerging hotspot

up-to-date visitor numbers for tyre are hard to come by, but philippe tabet, owner of two boutique hotels in the city, says business is robust.

he opened dar alma in march 2015, and dar camelia two months ago.

""dar alma is fully booked from april through to the end of september,"" he tells cnn. ""dar carmelia is new, but occupancy is already very good.""

four-fifths of his customers are lebanese, while the others mostly hail from european countries such as france, italy and norway.

""i have many repeat bookings: some people have already booked now for next summer,"" tabet adds.

in spite of tabet's buoyant business, tyre remains a well-kept secret to many outside of lebanon. its far from tranquil past may have something to do with this.

after several previous episodes of violence, including the 1975-1990 lebanese civil war, the city suffered heavily during the july 2006 conflict between israel and hezbollah, the lebanese political party and militia whose members mostly follow the shi'ite branch of islam.

in 2006, unesco issued an urgent appeal to both sides to spare tyre's roman ruins from damage, warning that they faced ""serious threat"" due to the conflict.

some foreign ministries, including the us state department , still advise against travel to tyre and lebanon as a whole, citing, ""threats of terrorism, armed clashes, kidnapping.""

the british foreign office told cnn there are no travel restrictions for tyre but it recommends citizens closely follow its frequently updated travel advice regarding lebanon. similarly, france recommends vigilance but does not advise against travel.

yet tyre has come a long way since the violence of the latter part of the 20th century and the beginning of this century.

""i have friends from beirut who used to be scared of tyre,"" says tabet, the hotel owner, himself from the southern city. ""but they discovered it through coming to dar alma and they broke the fear.""

hezbollah -- whose name means ""party of god"" -- is very much still present in tyre, where it commands widespread support. yet this is not always the case elsewhere in lebanon, especially amongst the country's christian and sunni populations.

two of the four city mps for tyre are from hezbollah while the other two are from the amal party, another shia political movement and frequent ally in parliament.

according to tony badran, a research fellow with expertise in lebanon and hezbollah at washington dc-based think tank the foundation for defense of democracies, hezbollah is popular in tyre as the city is majority shi'ite.

tyre also ""carries much symbolism for the party in relation to its resistance lore,"" badran tells cnn, referring to what hezbollah sees as its role defending lebanon against israel.

many outside the city, however, see hezbollah in more menacing terms.

in 2006, militant group hezbollah fought a war with neighboring israel, resulting in the deployment of un forces. here, a boy lies on the beach in tyre as spanish un troops arrive in the city. dominique faget/afp/afp/getty images

hezbollah souvenirs

on roads into the city, the party's distinctive budgerigar yellow and green flags fly from every lamp post. beside them are posters emblazoned with the faces of men killed fighting israel and in syria . but there is little hostility to visitors in tyre. for a start, hezbollah wants you to buy its souvenirs.

souk vendors sell snap-band bracelets and keyrings adorned with the face of hezbollah's bearded secretary-general, hassan nasrallah.

the organization's flags are available to purchase alongside those of fc barcelona and real madrid, the popular spanish soccer teams beloved across the middle east.

one seller shows off his cd collection: religious anthems, nasrallah speeches, and one new album of songs devoted to hezbollah's latest military action on the syria-lebanon border.

mixing and mingling

it might seem odd that a city where the islamist hezbollah has widespread public support and political power also serves as a summer beach party hotspot. alcohol is freely available, and women walk on the public beach in skimpy bikinis.

""there are christians, sunnis, and shi'ites in tyre and there aren't problems between them,"" insists jalal, the archeological site keeper.

zouheir halawi opened tavolino pub in the winding streets behind tyre's port four years ago. it resembles a spanish taverna: chairs sit beneath a low stone arched roof, and jars of olives line the bar.

""i wanted to do a proper pub, not a restaurant-bar or similar. i don't have problems selling alcohol here,"" he tells cnn, citing the city's mixed population, made up of christians, shia and sunni muslims.

testimony to that is the crowd in his pub one thursday night -- a group of friends of different sects all of whom are drinking and smoking.

""everyone comes here, even the snobs i ran away from in beirut,"" continues zouheir. ""you have the easy life in tyre, and it is as calm as you make it.""

that is not to say that there haven't been tensions. in 2012 -- before tavolino's launch -- a series of bomb attacks in the city appeared to target shops selling alcohol, according to reuters reports from the time.

tyre on the rise

today, however, zouheir is more concerned about an influx of wealthy lebanese and foreigners driving up prices and gentrifying tyre.

""from a business point of view, it is good, but from a personal point of view, it isn't. this is a mediterranean city and it needs to be authentic.""

tyre's boutique hotels already do not come cheap: a suite at dar alma costs $330 a night.

tabet responds to fears about gentrification with the belief that wealthy visitors bring money into tyre.

""the hotels are expensive on purpose, to bring in a high-end clientele, who spend money in the city -- i didn't want a mass market hotel,"" he says.

with accommodation dear, tyre's 4-kilometer-long free, public beach becomes all the more precious. beaches without entrance fees are a rarity in lebanon. families from all walks of life jump in the warm waves and shelter from the heat under parasols.

(cnn) after a violent year serving in the mountains of eastern afghanistan, i returned to the war-torn land in early 2012. on august 8 of that year, i was leading a security detail near the pakistani border in asadabad when my fellow soldier, sgt. 1st class brian brink, noticed a suspicious figure stumbling toward our patrol.

it took eight seconds for me to reach the threat, who i soon realized was a suicide bomber. after i threw him to the ground, the attacker detonated his vest.

while most of our patrol survived, four incredible men did not. usaid foreign service officer ragaei abdelfattah, us air force maj. david gray, and us army command sgt. maj. kevin griffin were among the dead. the fourth american hero to make the ultimate sacrifice that day was us army maj. tom kennedy.

before kennedy deployed to afghanistan, a neighbor asked why he was returning to the battlefield despite two previous tours in iraq.

""i'm a soldier,"" kennedy replied. ""this is what i do.""

although tom and i would eventually cross paths in afghanistan, how we got there was different. while he grew up playing hockey in the new york suburbs, the early part of my childhood was spent kicking around a soccer ball in a town near paris. in 1994, i arrived in the united states at 12 years old.

soon after my family settled into a washington suburb, i received the dreadful news that my uncle abdou, an algerian soldier, had been murdered by islamic extremists. that terrible day pointed me toward military service, but it wasn't until the terrorist attacks of september 11, 2001, that i ultimately decided to join the army. at the time, i had dual citizenship in france and the united states. after waiting for the french government to renounce my citizenship, i enlisted in the army in 2008.

as an immigrant, i wanted to earn my place as an american. while serving in the military wasn't the only way to do so, i felt an intense desire to give back to a country that had already given me so many opportunities to learn, grow and succeed.

when i made the choice to serve, i knew that death was a part of war. but nothing really prepares you for it. i lost 50% of my lower left calf, lost hearing in my left ear, was in the hospital for 2.5 years and had 33 surgeries, but seeing the bodies of my fallen friends hurt more than the injuries i suffered in the explosion. it was the worst moment of my life.

my team of fellow survivors and i wouldn't reunite until 2015, on the night before veterans day. as i write in my new book, "" 8 seconds of courage ,"" the pain of losing friends in battle never subsides.

over a few beers later that night, brink -- the first soldier to spot the suicide bomber -- pulled me aside to share that one of the soldiers in our group was still having a hard time speaking about the events of that day. after we asked the soldier how he was doing, he eventually decided not to participate in the next day's marathon interview session.

more than three years after the suicide bombing, my army brother was still hurting deeply inside, which made sharing his story with strangers very difficult. it reminded me that so many combat veterans, including myself, grapple with these types of emotions daily.

i received the medal of honor from president barack obama on november 12, 2015. what made the ceremony so special was that my fellow afghanistan veterans and -- most importantly -- the families of my fallen military brothers were able to join us at the white house.

for me, the meaning of veterans day changed forever on august 8, 2012. it is a day to honor all who have served, like my four fallen friends and fellow veterans like brink and my medic, spc. daniel balderrama, who helped save my life. it is also a day to thank their families, who often sacrifice every bit as much as the man or woman who deploys.

sixteen years after the us-led coalition's invasion of afghanistan, i believe america has found a new ""greatest generation."" without taking anything away from the patriots who fought in world war ii, korea, vietnam, desert storm and other conflicts, the current all-volunteer force will likely be forced to shoulder at least two decades of constant war.

when i made my decision to serve on 9/11, a future warrior was sitting in kindergarten or preschool, too young to comprehend the horrors of terrorists flying planes into the world trade center, the pentagon and a pennsylvania field. today, that young man or woman is following in the footsteps of my teammates in afghanistan and other global hot spots.

all americans have a sacred duty to not only spotlight the sacrifices of fallen heroes, gold star families, and veterans, but also to thank the next greatest generation of vets. without their willingness to step forward in wartime, we would be at the mercy of enemies much like the evil men who murdered my uncle and stole my friends from their loved ones.

those of us who have experienced war firsthand also have a responsibility to honor and nurture the brave men and women who are still fighting. after all, to slightly modify the powerful words of maj. tom kennedy: we are veterans, and this is what we do.

damian green, the first secretary of state and effectively prime minister theresa may's deputy, said the story, which was first reported in the sunday times, was ""completely untrue and comes from a tainted and untrustworthy source.""

according to the sunday times, former metropolitan police assistant commissioner bob quick alleged that the material was discovered on one of green's parliamentary computers by police officers conducting an inquiry into government leaks in 2008.

""the allegations about the material and computer, now nine years old, are false, disreputable political smears from a discredited police officer acting in flagrant breach of his duty to keep the details of police investigations confidential, and amount to little more than an unscrupulous character assassination,"" green said in a statement published on twitter.

the allegations against green come on the same day that journalist and cnn contributor jane merrick revealed that former defence secretary michael fallon lunged at her and attempted to kiss her on the lips after a lunch meeting in 2003.

fallon resigned from his post last wednesday, the day after admitting he had touched the knee of journalist julia hartley-brewer at a conference dinner 15 years ago.

merrick, who was 29 at the time, wrote in the observer that she felt ""humiliated, ashamed.""

she added: ""was i even guilty that maybe i had led him on in some way by drinking with him? after years of having a drink with so many other mps who have not acted inappropriately towards me, i now know i was not.""

thank you to the dozens of people who have expressed their support. for those who want to criticise, please read the whole article first. — jane merrick (@janemerrick23) november 5, 2017

merrick said she phoned downing street at 5 p.m. on wednesday to report the incident to one of the prime minister's aides -- by 7.30 p.m. fallon had resigned.

the latest revelations will come as a hammer blow to prime minister may, who will meet with fellow party leaders later this week to discuss plans for tackling sexual harassment and abuse in parliament.

speaking on ""the andrew marr show"" on sunday, home secretary amber rudd said there will be a ""clear-out"" in westminster after the avalanche of claims.

""i know that the cabinet office is going to be looking at this tomorrow along with the wider inquiry about damian, and i do think that we shouldn't rush to allege anything until that inquiry has taken place,"" she added.

further allegations

saturday's allegations against green come days after he was accused by journalist kate maltby of making unwanted advances toward her during a meeting in 2015.

writing in the times of london newspaper on wednesday, maltby said: ""he offered me career advice and in the same breath made it clear he was sexually interested. it was not acceptable to me at the time and it should not be acceptable behavior in westminster in the future.""

she said green, who was a friend of the family nearly 30 years her senior, had ""steered the conversation to the habitual nature of sexual affairs in parliament,"" before mentioning that ""his own wife was very understanding.""

she added: ""i felt a fleeting hand against my knee -- so brief, it was almost deniable. i moved my legs away, and tried to end the drink on friendly terms.""

one conservative lawmaker has called for green to be suspended pending an investigation.

green described those allegations as ""completely untrue"" and ""deeply hurtful"" in a statement wednesday.

he added: ""this untrue allegation has come as a complete shock and is deeply hurtful, especially from someone i considered a personal friend.""

maltby, who also contributes to cnn, said she had dropped all contact with green after the encounter. but in may last year, she said, he contacted her by text message after seeing a piece she had written for the times on the history of corsets that included an image of her wearing one.

according to maltby, green's text message read: ""long time no see. but having admired you in a corset in my favorite tabloid i feel impelled to ask if you are free for a drink anytime?""

maltby said she had ignored the message but had since had contact with green on a professional basis.

""awkward relationships like this are part of being a young woman in westminster,"" she wrote. ""it shouldn't be the norm -- which is why i have chosen to speak out. but it's crucial to understand that most of us have to maintain relationships with such men in order to thrive professionally.""

fellow conservative lawmaker anna soubry has called for green to be suspended while the investigation takes place.

may has launched an investigation into the allegations made by maltby, while a number of other conservative lawmakers have also found themselves facing investigation.

labour party allegations

the allegations of sexual abuse and harassment are not confined to one party, with the labour party also being criticized for its handling of the issue.

labour lawmaker kelvin hopkins has denied any wrongdoing.

last week, labour activist ava etemadzadeh said the party took three years to act after she informed them that mp kelvin hopkins, 76, made inappropriate physical contact with her and sent her unprofessional text messages.

in a statement issued by his solicitors and reported by the uk press association, hopkins said: ""i absolutely categorically deny that i in any way engaged in such inappropriate conduct.""

a recent investigation has also been launched into the case of bex bailey, a former labour activist , who revealed she was raped at a party event at age 19, and was discouraged from reporting the attack by a senior official. bailey did not name her attacker.

there is also a complaint against lawmaker clive lewis who is accused of groping a woman at the party's annual conference. lewis strenuously denies the allegation.

the claims come in the wake of the scandal involving accusations of sexual assault and harassment against hollywood producer harvey weinstein, and the #metoo campaign, in which victims of sexual abuse have been sharing their experiences.

THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Seattle","(cnn) north korea tested an intercontinental ballistic missile friday that appears to have the range to hit major us cities, experts say, and prompted a fresh round of condemnation from the united states, china, japan and south korea.

a combination of us, south korean and japanese analyses of the launch from mupyong-ni, near north korea's border with china, shows the missile flew about 45 minutes, going 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles) high and for a distance of 1,000 kilometers (621 miles).

if the missile were fired on a flatter, standard trajectory, it would have major us cities such as los angeles, denver and chicago well within its range, with the possible ability to reach as far as new york and boston, according to david wright , a missile expert at the union of concerned scientists.

however, early analysis of friday's test cannot determine how heavy a payload the missile was carrying in its warhead, wright said. the heavier the payload, the shorter the range.

south korea's joint chiefs of staff said they estimate the missile tested friday is more advanced than one launched earlier this month based on the range it traveled. experts had said that test showed pyongyang had the ability to hit alaska

president donald trump condemned the missile launch and said the united states would act to ensure its security.

""threatening the world, these weapons and tests further isolate north korea, weaken its economy and deprive its people,"" trump said in a written statement. ""the united states will take all necessary steps to ensure the security of the american homeland and protect our allies in the region.""

kim calls weapons program a 'precious asset'

pyongyang's state-run korean central news agency said saturday that the latest missile launch was a hwasong-14, the same missile tested earlier this month.

friday's test was designed to show the hwasong-14's maximum range with a ""large-sized heavy nuclear warhead,"" it said, adding that washington should regard the launch as a ""grave warning.""

north korean state media was quick to tout the missile test as a success, with video and stills showing leader kim jong un overseeing the launch and celebrating with the troops involved.

north koreans hailed the test-firing, the news agency said. kim yu chol, a researcher at the state academy of sciences, called the achievement ""another great victory which dealt a heavy blow to the us imperialists and its vassal forces."" jo son hyang, a resident of pyongyang's rangnang district, said the ""future of the country is bright"" now that it has a ""powerful sword for keeping peace.""

kim was quoted as saying ""the whole us mainland"" is now within north korea's reach. he called pyongyang's weapons program ""a precious asset"" that cannot be reversed or replaced, according to the agency.

in the wake of the test, the us joint chiefs of staff chairman, gen. joseph f. dunford jr., and adm. harry harris, commander of us pacific command, called the south korean joint chiefs of staff chairman, gen. lee sun jin, to express ""ironclad commitment"" to the us alliance with south korea and discuss military response options.

hours after that call, the us and south korean military conducted a live-fire exercise as a show of force in response to the test, according to pentagon spokesman capt. jeff davis. the exercise included firing missiles into the ocean.

both militaries conducted a similar show of force after north korea's first icbm test in early july.

if north korea's assertions about friday's test are true, pyongyang may be even more advanced in its missile program than previously thought. earlier in the week, a us official told cnn the united states believed that north korea would be able to launch a reliable nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile by early 2018.

the official said that while north korea can currently get a missile ""off the ground,"" a lot of undetermined variables remain about guidance, re-entry and the ability to hit a specific target.

china condemns launch

china, a longtime north korean ally, issued a statement saturday condemning the missile launch and asked pyongyang to ""stop taking actions that would escalate tensions"" on the korean peninsula.

""the un security council has clear regulations on north korea's launch activities that use ballistic missile technologies. china is opposed to north korea's launch activities in violation of un security council resolutions and against the will of the international community,"" chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang said.

beijing's statement reiterated its long-held position on north korea's missile program.

us secretary of state rex tillerson said china and russia need to do more to stop north korea.

""as the principal economic enablers of north korea's nuclear weapon and ballistic missile development program, china and russia bear unique and special responsibility for this growing threat to regional and global stability,"" tillerson said in a statement.

after speaking saturday with tillerson, japanese foreign minister fumio kishida said tokyo would join washington in new appeals to those countries to stop north korea.

the missile splashed down about 200 kilometers (120 miles) west of the shakotan peninsula of japan's northernmost main island of hokkaido, well within japan's exclusive economic zone, kishida said.

not everyone agrees that north korea launched an icbm. the russian defense ministry said its tracking indicated the weapon was a ""medium-range ballistic missile,"" russian state news agency tass reported friday.

nuclear-capable missile?

michael elleman of the international institute for strategic studies estimated a range of at least 9,500 kilometers (5,900 miles) for the missile, according to reuters news agency -- less than that estimated by wright, but still potentially putting los angeles within reach.

""the key here is that north korea has a second successful test in less than one month,"" he said. ""if this trend holds, they could establish an acceptably reliable icbm before year's end.""

north korea has seen a year of rapid progress in its missile program.

pyongyang has carried out 12 missile tests since february and conducted its first test of an icbm on july 4 -- which it says could reach ""anywhere in the world.""

""north korea is slowly morphing into a nuclear and missile power right before our very eyes,"" said harry j. kazianis, director of defense studies at the center for the national interest and an expert on north korea.

""north korea will continue to test over and over again its missile technology and nuclear weapons in the months and years to come in order to develop the most lethal systems it can,"" kazianis said. ""you can bet every time they do tensions will continue to rise. this is what makes the situation on the korean peninsula as dangerous as it is.""

trump urged to respond

less than six years in power, kim has tested more missiles than his father and grandfather combined.

the latest test has spurred calls for a response from the trump administration.

""north korea's latest missile test shows the trump administration's actions are not changing north korea's behavior and it's time for the president to articulate a comprehensive strategy to the american people -- so far he's failed to do that,"" democratic rep. ted lieu told cnn on friday.

administration officials have warned that ""all options are on the table"" but a clear path forward has yet to materialize.

doug bandow, a senior fellow at the cato institute who specializes in foreign policy, told cnn that north korea's missile launch shows its leaders are ""absolutely committed to their missile programs"" and not interested in tempering their activities.

bandow, who visited north korea last month, said the regime is convinced that developing its missile program as a nuclear deterrent is absolutely necessary. it's a mindset, he said, that puts pressure on trump, who finds himself in a situation with no good choices.

which puts republicans -- especially those facing potentially serious primary challenges or who sit in swing districts in the general election -- in a no-win position.
and, in turn, more open seats make for a more volatile political environment for republicans.

(this was true of president barack obama and republicans; obama was, effectively, the only person who was able to unite the republican party.) THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Chicago","washington (cnn) ed gillespie's resounding loss in tuesday's virginia governor's race -- coupled with a series of other losses in lower-profile races around the country -- will likely take what was bubbling concern among republicans about their prospects in the 2018 midterms and transform it into a frothing cauldron of panic.

that panic is born not from the fact of gillespie's defeat but the way in which he lost -- and the role president donald trump and trumpism played in that loss.

gillespie, like lots and lots of republicans in the house and senate, is very much an establishment figure. a former chairman of the republican national committee. a senior member of bushworld. a gop lobbyist. a conservative but someone willing to compromise. a pragmatist not an ideologue.

and yet, on the biggest election night since trump engaged in a hostile takeover of the gop 18 months ago, even gillespie was unable to escape the trump vortex. despite largely keeping trump at arm's length -- a fact the president noted in a ""don't blame me"" tweet shortly after the race was called tuesday night -- gillespie watched as anti-trump sentiment in key regions of the commonwealth doomed his chances of pulling off an upset victory. (worth noting: in the race's final weeks, gillespie embraced many elements of trump messaging -- defending confederate monuments, attacking ms-13 and sanctuary cities etc.)

from the dc exurbs of loudoun county (where northam won by an eye-popping 20 points) to the conservative richmond suburbs of chesterfield county (where gillespie appeared to eke out a win), voters turned out in droves to send a clear message to trump: we don't like what you're doing. at all.

almost six in 10 virginians disapproved of the job trump is doing as president, according to exit polling. half of the virginia electorate said that trump was a major factor in their vote on tuesday; of that group, twice as many said they saw their vote as a way to voice opposition to trump as said they voted the way they did to express support for the president.

there's simply no way to explain the demolition of gillespie in the suburbs and exurbs other than a strong distaste for trump among those voters.

and, for all of the caveats and the don't-read-too-much-into-one-race-ism by the ""smart"" political reporters, the simple fact is that every single republican politician in the halls of congress will be paying very close attention to what happened in virginia tuesday night and wondering what it all means for them.

what it means -- at least as of today -- is this: trump remains a potent and powerful force in republican primaries. but, he is a potentially toxic taint with the broader general electorate.

which puts republicans -- especially those facing potentially serious primary challenges or who sit in swing districts in the general election -- in a no-win position. run away from trump and risk losing your primary fight. run with trump and risk losing the general election. badly.

already, faced with the possibility of being driven out of the party by the pro-trump forces, a number of republicans from the so-called ""governing wing"" of the gop are heading for the exits.

new jersey rep. frank lobiondo joined their ranks on tuesday -- before the election results were known -- with a statement that tilted very heavily toward his distaste for the current political realities within his party.

""as some of my closest colleagues have also come to realize, those of us who came to congress to change washington for the better through good governance are now the outliers,"" lobiondo said . ""in legislating, we previously fought against allowing the perfect to become the enemy of the good. today, a vocal and obstinate minority within both parties has hijacked good legislation in pursuit of no legislation.""

lobiondo joines the likes of reps. dave reichert (washington), charlie dent (pennsylvania), ileana ros-lehtinen (florida) and dave trott (michigan) as members of the pragmatic wing of the gop -- all of whom represent seats that will be democratic pickup targets -- calling it quits in advance of the 2018 election.

for members who remain on the fence about whether or not to stick around for another term, the virginia results will be terrifying. and, in turn, more open seats make for a more volatile political environment for republicans. and the more open seats for democrats to target, the better chance they have at making a very serious run at regaining their house majority next november. and the possibility of going from the majority to the minority come 2019 will be a major disincentive for republicans pondering their political futures.

in short: panic builds on itself. it snowballs.

the across-the-board losses in virginia, not to mention other republican defeats on long island, new jersey, maine, new hampshire and washington state -- among others -- suggest that trump is not only a drag on his party in general elections but also a massive turnout motivator for the democratic base. (this was true of president barack obama and republicans; obama was, effectively, the only person who was able to unite the republican party.)

waking up wednesday morning, republicans are being smacked in the face with the reality of a trump presidency: he is a man beloved by their base and disliked almost everywhere else.

(cnn) what the american public craves is authenticity: a sense that the men and women we elect are, like us, flesh-and-blood creatures who celebrate and grieve, who dance and despair. but it's rare to see politician reveal his or her vulnerability before a mass television audience.

and that is why vice president joe biden's appearance on ""the late show"" with stephen colbert on thursday night was so uncommonly moving. in the face of biden's offhand honesty, passion and wrenching humanity as he discussed his beloved son beau's death from brain cancer earlier this summer, it is almost embarrassing to acknowledge that it made for ""good television.""

it was life happening before our eyes, the kind of life we find in our own living rooms and kitchens.

real conversation about the human experience is something we don't expect on late night -- from arch hosts, and particularly from politicians, who often seem like pieces of styrofoam.

the biden appearance slapped the nation awake, reminding us that we've become almost numb as we listen to the excuses, the prevarications, the bragging, the naked vanity that seems to dominate both major parties in this election season.

it seems unlikely now that biden will run, not after this interview, where stephen colbert — the most gifted interviewer in america today -- brought up ""the elephant in the room,"" which he cleverly suggested was really a donkey. he referred to the pressing political question of the moment: will joe biden challenge hillary clinton and others in the ongoing democratic primary?

a lot hung on his answer, and the whole nation leaned forward to listen.

biden was shockingly frank for a man under the klieg lights. his face was extremely mobile, with a range of emotion flickering as he dipped his eyes to the floor and seemed to wince. a vast audience saw the obvious truth: here is father grieving for beloved son, beau, who died of brain cancer only a few months ago. the rawness of his feelings were vividly on display.

biden was frank, saying: ""i don't think any man or woman should run for president unless, number one, they know exactly why they would want to be president and, number two, they can look at folks out there and say, 'i promise you, you have my whole heart, my whole soul, my energy, and my passion to do this."" one could hear a pin drop in the audience, which held its breath. ""and i'd be lying if i said that i knew i was there,"" biden added, more or less putting the kibosh on a presidential bid.

he could backtrack, of course, claiming that suddenly a voice had come to him from heaven, saying ""run, joe, run!"" but that seems highly unlikely now. voters would genuinely have to wonder if biden really had the heart, the energy and the passion to give to this difficult and demanding job. running for high public office can't be easy. and it's clear that even joe doesn't think he can manage it in the wake of his son's death.

it's easy to say why so many like joe biden a great deal. i'm among them. he's a compassionate human being, and he's real.

born in 1942, he grew up in scranton, pennsylvania -- the lunch-pail capital of the western world, in my view. i grew up only a mile or so from biden, whose father scraped to find work during some hard economic times in this era, when anthracite mining had died out and left many in northeastern pennsylvania without other options for making a living. my mother, who died at 97 only last year, was a friend of biden's aunt and mother, and she recalled that they moved to delaware in search of better work.

like so many baby boomers, joe was among the first in his family to have a college education, which he managed to get with the aid of scholarships, attending the university of delaware and law school at syracuse.

ordinary americans identify with biden. he wasn't born with a silver spoon in his mouth -- like jeb bush or donald trump. he made his way -- slowly but surely -- in the often clamorous world of american politics. and he has risen to a height his family could scarcely have imagined in those hardscrabble years after the war in scranton.

joe is the real deal. he would have made a great president, perhaps: a man of the people, who understands their needs, their fondest wishes, their fears. but that probably isn't going to happen.

(cnn) the last time baghdad sent troops into kirkuk to kick out kurdish forces, i was in the first group of journalists taken to see the aftermath.

bloated bodies and blown-up trucks littered the road as we arrived.

fresh on the heels of the allied liberation of kuwait in 1991, swaths of iraq's downtrodden rose up against saddam hussein. the shia in the south and the kurds in the north were both brutally crushed.

around kirkuk we witnessed the ugly aftermath of more killings. kurds who had been gunned down, their bodies untouched where they fell.

it was, as my wife -- then a cnn correspondent -- reported, ""an object lesson in brutality.""

although baghdad's offensive in kirkuk this week is tame by comparison, it is nevertheless an object lesson not just for the kurds, but for the us -- and president trump in particular.

the iraqi government forces arrived in us-made humvees and abrams tanks backed by shia militias who are supported by iran. both the us and iran are vying for influence in iraq.

iran's claim is historic, rooted in religious ideology. by contrast, america appears as the johnny-come-lately.

so when trump refused to recertify iran's compliance of the iran nuclear deal last week and threatened to designate iran's top military force, the revolutionary guard -- the irgc -- a terrorist organization, he wasn't just slapping down the theocracy -- he was also upping the stakes in iraq.

in part drawing a line in the sand; in part throwing sand in the faces of iran's leaders. iran's supreme leader the ayatollah ali khamenei is throwing sand back, pledging to undermine us interests in iraq and by implication its kurdish region.

not long after my visit to kirkuk in 1991, the us designated kurdish areas a safe zone, denying saddam access.

since then, the kurds -- under their leader masoud barzani -- have cemented autonomy and grown claims for independence, wooing america as a protector by granting oil rights and offering strategic airbases for them -- some close to iran's border.

but last month, barzani pushed the relationship to the brink by forcing through a kurdish referendum on independence against the express wishes of america, iraq, and iran. only israel accepted the kurds' overwhelming call for independence.

on the eve of iraq's kurdish offensive this week, an irgc general slipped into kirkuk with two iraqi generals and told the kurds to get out or be crushed.

both the president and the iranians have put their cards on the table: trump can't abide them; they want american influence in the region gone. the days of cooperating over isis are likely not long for this world.

a marriage of convenience is splintering, as they so often do, into a messy separation.

if the iran deal was the pre-nup, the divorce won't be about who gets to keep how much enriched uranium as much as it will be about who gets which country or region as a sphere of influence.

the fault lines have been solidifying for decades. a first faint trace came almost a century ago with the sykes-picot division of the post-ottoman middle east.

the sultan's caliphate was parceled up into trans-tribal, trans-ethnic and trans-secular countries whose citizens were new to such nationhood.

in the century since, kings and dictators have mostly sought to subjugate in their own interest. national interest has only ever been a tool wielded to hold on to power.

it is why iraq and syria are in turmoil today and why lebanon is still recovering from a civil war that ended over two decades ago. the region is fragile and every outside player makes it more brittle.

as former us secretary of state colin powell apparently told president george w. bush: ""if you break it, you own it.""

donald trump may not have created this mess, but his recent pronouncements on the iran deal appear to lack the leadership skills that would be expected of a us president.

indeed, trump seems to be the only person unable to comprehend the ripple effect of his actions.

trump's sabre rattling on iran and north korea isn't just ensuring that citizens of those countries get in line behind their regimes, but it also exposes the paucity of his policies to a global audience.

all of the other signatories to the deal -- russia, china, germany, france and the uk as well as the eu -- urged against doing what he did and risk triggering a collapse of the deal.

eu foreign policy chief federica mogherini sounded particularly bitter : ""it is not (a) bilateral agreement. it does not belong to any single country. and it is not up to any single country to terminate it.""

trump's more than 200 days in office are shearing him of his allies' close support.

his decision on iran shredded any last vestige of doubt for trump's critics and most of his allies that he is setting america's international standing back years -- maybe decades.

his statement on iran has been the culmination of months of unease that most european leaders had hoped could be avoided.

within a week, their worst fears may be taking shape. kurds routed from kirkuk by iranian-backed forces and the real possibility of a bigger confrontation that could mean more refugees spilling into europe.

the assumption that trump's impulses can be kept in check by wiser minds in his administration is being challenged.

secretary of state rex tillerson said: ""president trump's foreign-policy goals break the mold of what people traditionally think is achievable on behalf of our country ... we're finding new ways to govern that deliver new victories.""

on iran, defense secretary james mattis said: ""i give advice to the president, he was elected by the american people and i stand by the iran strategy as it came out today.""

and chief of staff john kelly offered this guidance on his role at the white house: ""i was not sent in to -- or brought in to control him.""

what's really worrying european diplomats is what could happen if another middle east conflict kicked off.

in 2015, a massive wave of refugees principally from the syrian conflict shifted europe's politics to the right and changed the face of the continent.

more evidence of this came in austria's elections last weekend: the world's youngest-ever leader surfing into power on a wave of anti-migrant rhetoric.

voters in germany, france and holland have also boosted nationalist hopes of a revival in the immediate aftermath of britain's brexit vote.

europe is experiencing a reactionary lurch in which nationalists feel emboldened -- and the refugees of syria's civil war helped make that happen.

another middle east war would likely cloud europe's horizons further. isis is using the moment to stoke primal fears. a perfect storm may be brewing.

THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Indianapolis","washington (cnn) after a year of doubts, recriminations and special election misfires, democrats finally got the big victories tuesday they'd so desperately craved in the year since donald trump won the presidency.

ralph northam won the virginia governor's race and phil murphy took a new jersey governor's office that had been in republican chris christie's hands for eight years. across the map, in mayoral contests, state legislative races and ballot measures, everything broke democrats' way.

republicans will wake up wednesday in a nightmare: all of a sudden, full control of congress might be in serious jeopardy. trump's low approval ratings look toxic. and it could be much harder to convince incumbents to run -- and to recruit candidates into open-seat races -- in such a difficult environment.

here are five takeaways from democrats' big day:

1. the blue wave

democrats won races large and small tuesday, starting with the new jersey and virginia governor's races.

the party won hotly contested mayoral races in charlotte, north carolina, and st. petersburg, florida. in maine, voters approved a ballot measure to expand medicaid under the affordable care act.

in virginia, northam didn't just beat republican ed gillespie in the northern virginia suburbs -- he crushed him. consider loudoun county near washington: democrats won it by 5 points in the 2013 governor's race, and 20 points on tuesday.

democrats were also within striking distance of flipping the 17 seats they needed to take the virginia house of delegates -- giving the party much more influence on redistricting in 2020.

it all gives democrats a huge psychological boost that could help their fundraising and candidate recruitment. it could also accelerate the pace of republican retirements, as republican bob mcdonnell's win in the 2009 virginia governor's race did for democrats. already on tuesday, new jersey republican rep. frank lobiondo announced his retirement -- creating another toss-up seat. there could soon be more.

2. trumpism without trump didn't work

gillespie and trump didn't campaign together. but gillespie tried just about every trick in trump's bag.

his television ads portrayed northam as enabling the ms-13 gang by being soft on immigration enforcement. he picked up on trump's culture wars, hitting nfl players for kneeling during the national anthem and promising to keep virginia's confederate monuments up.

it was all an effort to convince trump voters to turn out for a former lobbyist and george w. bush aide.

it failed.

gillespie did well in rural virginia. but the democratic base that slumbered through 2016 turned out in full force and the suburbs shifted dramatically in northam's favor.

""virginia sent a strong message that trump-style division -- pitting people against people -- that is not the virginia way. that is not the american way,"" virginia sen. tim kaine said at northam's victory party.

trump tried to lay the blame solely at gillespie's feet, tweeting, ""ed gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what i stand for. don't forget, republicans won 4 out of 4 house seats, and with the economy doing record numbers, we will continue to win, even bigger than before!""

ed gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what i stand for. don't forget, republicans won 4 out of 4 house seats, and with the economy doing record numbers, we will continue to win, even bigger than before! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) november 8, 2017

now, republicans have to confront the possibility that they'll face the same problem democrats faced during the presidency of barack obama: his popularity doesn't transfer to them.

trump campaigned in alabama for sen. luther strange -- who promptly lost a republican primary to former judge roy moore. he recorded a robocall and tweeted for gillespie, who was walloped in what both sides expected to be a close race. trump voters turn out for trump -- but so far, no one else.

3. republicans lost the culture war

beyond the governor's race, democrats won a decisive victory on the social and cultural issues that have dominated virginia politics.

democrat danica roem became the only openly transgender state lawmaker in america. she beat bob marshall, who had advocated for a bill restricting which bathrooms transgender people could use.

one of the biggest forces in the virginia races was planned parenthood, which helped democrats defeat a republican lieutenant governor nominee, jill vogel, who as a state senator had pushed a bill requiring women seeking abortions to undergo vaginal ultrasounds.

and in the virginia attorney general's race, incumbent democrat mark herring cruised despite republican john adams' attacks on herring's decision not to defend the state's same-sex marriage ban in court.

to be sure, northam was hobbled by gillespie's ms-13 ad. he appeared to flip-flop at the last minute and said he opposed sanctuary cities -- a decision that appeared to be out of desperation. in other states with less democratic voters, his stumbles could have led to a loss.

but up and down the ticket, the gop focus on social issues proved costly tuesday in virginia.

4. obama and biden help democrats

the democratic party lost about 1,000 state legislative seats during obama's presidency across the country -- eight years in which democratic strategists howled about the white house's inattention to the party's crumbling infrastructure and its down-ballot disasters.

now out of office, obama and biden both focused on 2017 races. and it turned out the two made pretty effective democratic surrogates.

biden-endorsed candidates were on course for a clean sweep. and obama's rallies in new jersey and virginia, which drew thousands to hear his lectures that the party's base had gotten ""complacent"" in non-presidential elections, appear to have energized the minority voters that northam's campaign had worried might stay at home. while the northern virginia results will get the most national attention, northam ran up his lead throughout virginia's entire urban crescent -- stretching from the washington suburbs through norfolk.

both obama and biden are showing an appetite to play surrogate roles in 2018. biden has already waded into december's alabama senate special election, and has done nothing to tamp down speculation that he might run for president in 2020. they'll be the most sought-after democratic surrogates over the next year.

5. mcauliffe 2020 starts now

the happiest person in virginia might be gov. terry mcauliffe.

the long-time friend of the clintons, fundraiser extraordinaire and former democratic national committee chairman wasn't taken particularly seriously as a candidate himself -- a principal, rather than a supporting player -- when he ran for governor in 2013.

now, mcauliffe seems impossible to ignore.

swaggering onto stage at northam's victory party to mark morrison's ""return of the mack,"" mcauliffe cast the election results as virginia's rejection of discrimination. he touted his own administration's efforts to protect lgbt workers, in a message that sounded 2020-ready.

a few weeks from leaving office, mcauliffe has made clear that he hasn't run out of political ambition. he leaves virginia as a popular democrat with a strong economic record and a revitalized democratic bench set to take office.

THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Indianapolis","(cnn) according to president donald trump, the tragic texas church shooting that left 26 people dead was ""a mental health problem at the highest level.""

if you ask mental health researchers, such mass shootings are much more complicated than that.

on sunday, 26-year-old devin kelley sprayed bullets across the sanctuary of first baptist church in sutherland springs, texas, about 30 miles east of san antonio. the youngest killed at the church was 17 months old; the oldest was 77 years old.

""we have a lot of mental health problems in our country, as do other countries, but this isn't a guns situation,"" trump said during a joint news conference monday in tokyo

""this is a mental health problem at the highest level,"" he said. ""it's a very, very sad event.""

trump's response to the texas church shooting echoed previous comments he has made on gun violence. in 2015, trump said he was opposed to tightening gun laws in the united states but was in favor of addressing mental health to prevent shootings.

yet various epidemiological studies over the past two decades show that the vast majority of people with severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or severe depression, are no more likely to be violent than anyone else

rather, people with severe mental illnesses are more than 10 times more likely to be victims of violent crime than the general population. and, only about 3% to 5% of violent acts can be attributed to individuals living with a serious mental illness, according to the us department of health and human services.

but those statistics have ""almost nothing to do with mass casualty shootings,"" said jeffrey swanson, a professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at duke university who specializes in gun violence and mental illness.

so exactly how are mental health and gun violence intertwined, and what is needed to end the violence?

gun violence and mental illness are public health problems ""that intersect at the edges"" but have very little overlap, swanson told cnn last year

there's no doubt that america's systems of care for mental health are overburdened, expensive and inaccessible for many who need them, he said. but when it comes to gun violence among this community, suicide tends to occur at higher rates than homicides, he said.

""if we back up and think about firearm-related injuries and mortality as a public health problem, it turns out there is a mental health-related story, and it's suicide,"" he said. ""if we had better mental health care and could get people better access and break down barriers to care, then yes, we might reduce gun violence by a lot but it would be from reducing suicides.""

otherwise, mental illness is just one ""highly unspecific"" factor that may contribute to gun violence, along with being young, white and male, or a history of violence, swanson said.

instead of policies that restrict gun access based solely on mental illness diagnoses or because a person has made contact with the judicial system or health care agencies due to mental illness, the american psychological association , the national alliance on mental illness and other advocacy groups have called for gun access criteria based on more subtle indicators of potentially dangerous behavior.

those indicators -- such as having past or pending violent misdemeanor convictions or charges, domestic violence restraining orders or multiple dui convictions -- have been largely informed by the work of swanson and others.

swanson supports intervention at the point of purchase through comprehensive background checks -- but to make background checks work, criteria for inclusion on the database should be based on other indicators of risk besides mental health history, such as those indicators of aggressive, impulsive or risky behavior.

""a history of violent behavior is a far better predictor of future violence than mental illness,"" he said.

calling gun violence a mental health issue is to scapegoat and stigmatize people with mental illness, he said.

""it's kind of a canard, a convenient explanation that exploits the tremendous fear people have with these horrifying mass shootings,"" he said. ""if people fear those with mental illness they're going to treat them with scorn and support public policies that restrict their liberties.""

after all, mental illness affects millions of adults across the country.

in 2015, there were an estimated 43.4 million adults in the united states with some form of mental illness within the past year, which represented 17.9% of adults nationwide, according to the national institute of mental health

the american psychological association recommends prohibiting firearms for high-risk groups, such as domestic violence offenders or persons convicted of violent misdemeanor crimes.

""reducing the incidence of gun violence will require interventions through multiple systems, including legal, public health, public safety, community, and health. increasing the availability of data and funding will help inform and evaluate policies designed to reduce gun violence,"" according to the association's website.

swanson and his colleagues examined the proportion of people in the united states with impulsive angry behavior who own or carry guns and have a diagnosable mental illness in a paper published in the journal behavioral sciences & the law in 2015.

they conducted household surveys with 9,282 people from february 2001 to april 2003, excluding people who carried guns for work, resulting in a response rate of 70.9%.

an analysis of the survey results estimated that nearly one in 10 adults has access to firearms and has a problem with anger and impulsive aggressive behavior.

these people were more likely to be male, younger and married and to live in outlying areas around metropolitan centers rather than in central cities, swanson and his colleagues wrote in their paper.

they were significantly more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for a wide range of mental disorders, including depression, bipolar and anxiety disorders, ptsd, intermittent explosive disorder, pathological gambling, eating disorder, alcohol and illicit drug use disorders, and a range of personality disorders.

what's more, despite evidence of ""considerable psychopathology"" in many of these respondents, only a very small proportion, 8% to 10%, were ever hospitalized for a mental health problem.

""because only a small proportion of persons with this risky combination have ever been involuntarily hospitalized for a mental health problem, most will not be subject to existing mental health-related legal restrictions on firearms resulting from a history of involuntary commitment,"" swanson and his colleagues wrote in the paper's abstract

(cnn) north korea's nuclear program presents a real and direct threat to the united states. north korea has ramped up the pace of its ballistic missile tests in recent months and conducted its sixth test of a nuclear weapon in september. experts have now determined that pyongyang has the capability to strike the us mainland with an intercontinental ballistic missile.

it is clear that our past efforts to rein in north korea's nuclear program have failed. bold action must be taken immediately, and the senate banking committee will move forward to do just that this week.

today, the committee will mark up the bipartisan otto warmbier banking restrictions involving north korea (brink) act of 2017, which we authored to impose mandatory sanctions on the foreign banks and companies that facilitate illicit financial transactions for north korea. the brink act sends a clear and unequivocal message to these banks and firms: you can do business with north korea or you can do business with the united states, but if you choose to support the north korean regime or their business associates, you will be held to account.

chris van hollen

patrick toomey

critics argue that, for more than two decades, the united states has unsuccessfully employed a mix of sanctions and economic incentives to convince north korea to abandon its nuclear arsenal and contain the threat. but our sanctions regime against north korea is not nearly as tough as what we had in place against iran, in the lead-up to iranian nuclear negotiations.

specifically, the united states has not, in a serious way, gone after the foreign banks that provide illicit support to north korea and extend credit and financial services to companies engaged in illegal trade with the regime. this is a major hole in our sanctions regime, but one that our legislation would close.

the sanctions in the brink act are known as ""secondary sanctions,"" because they apply to non-us entities. they target foreign banks and firms serving north korean enterprises. this bill is modeled on the same secondary sanctions that helped to bring iran to the negotiating table over its nuclear program.

the reasons for our approach are clear. north korea's economy is neither as weak nor as isolated as most people believe. while exact figures are unknown, its annual gross domestic product is estimated to be $40 billion. china accounts for nearly 90% of north korea's trade, while others, such as malaysia, still maintain diplomatic ties.

the united nations found that north korea evades existing international sanctions and maintains access to the international financial system through a comprehensive network of front companies, many based in china. north korea relies heavily on this network to directly support its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. our aim is to cut off north korea's remaining access to the international financial system, deprive kim jong un of the resources needed for his regime's survival, and create the leverage necessary for successful nuclear negotiations.

our bill also makes an example of those who evade sanctions. these initial sanctions will signal to other banks that the united states is serious about cracking down on entities facilitating business with north korea. they will dry the flow of funds between kim jong un's regime and the rest of the world. just as we saw with iran and in our sanctions policies with other countries, a credible threat of secondary sanctions would have a chilling effect on business with north korea and encourage due diligence by institutions who wish to maintain access to the us financial system.

critics of secondary sanctions argue that china may lash out at the united states. regardless of its reaction, the gravity of the situation compels us to act. furthermore, in september, beijing reportedly directed its state banks to suspend accounts held by north koreans, an action long required under un sanctions.

our legislation holds china accountable for its obligations. we believe tough secondary sanctions may finally change china's calculus with respect to north korea. it is in china's economic interest for its banks to be able to do business with american firms. moreover, it is in china's security interest to have a denuclearized peninsula, reduced tensions, and greater long-term stability in the region.

north korea is on track to acquire the capability to strike the us mainland with a nuclear weapon. the united states must use every economic weapon in our arsenal to prevent that from happening. severing the regime's global financial ties might raise the price of acquiring that capability to a level that kim jong un cannot afford. an aggressive secondary sanctions regime, as a part of a broader campaign of financial pressure and rigorous diplomacy, is our best remaining chance at peacefully resolving the north korean nuclear threat. we urge the full senate to pass this critical legislation immediately.

the epidemic, which began in august, has taken the lives of 133 people and resulted in 1,836 suspected or confirmed cases.

however, the occurrence of new cases is finally decreasing, according to a report released wednesday by the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs.

the week of october 9, there were 477 new cases, compared with 161 during the week of october 23. the report says 1,044 patients have been cured, and 83 others are receiving treatment.

the number of hospitalizations because of the plague has also decreased, according to the world health organization.

although the number of total cases has continued to increase, this is because of ""enhanced surveillance and ongoing investigations,"" the who said; some of the cases were not actually infected, upon inspection.

the unusual spread of pneumonic plague in this outbreak was due to one infected person who traveled to find care early in the outbreak, infecting people along the way. these individuals infected others, leading to several chains of transmission, added nyka alexander, a representative of the who health emergencies programme.

ongoing efforts to control the spread of bubonic and pneumonic plague include seeking out and treating new cases, identifying the method of disease contact, disease follow-up and antibiotic treatment, rodent and flea control, and ""safe and dignified burials,"" the who said in a statement.

low risk of international spread

extensive screening measures, informed travelers, short incubation periods of pneumonic plague, and increasing operational readiness of surrounding countries and islands has kept the risk of international spread low, said the who.

""the risk of international spread is low, because generally, people with plague are too sick to travel,"" said dr. charlotte ndiaye, a who representative in madagascar.

her organization is working closely with airport authorities to ensure that sanitary measures such as temperature checks and medical teams are in place at airports and ports to prevent the spread of infection outside the country. the group is also working closely with neighboring countries.

travel and trade restrictions have not been advised, but travelers arriving in madagascar should be informed about the outbreak and the necessary protection measures. these include avoiding crowded areas; avoiding contact with dead animals, infected tissues and materials; avoiding close contact with other patients; using repellent to prevent bug bites; and knowing where to seek medical treatment, according to the who.

it's ""important to recognize that, unlike ebola, plague is easily treated with antibiotics,"" said daniel bausch, director of the uk public health rapid support team, ""with very good outcomes, as long as detected and treated early.""

treatment and prevention

plague is caused by infection with the bacterium yersinia pestis and is typically spread through the bite of infected fleas, frequently carried by rats, causing bubonic plague.

pneumonic plague is more virulent or damaging and is an advanced form characterized by a severe lung infection. the infection can be transmitted from person to person via airborne droplets -- coughing or sneezing. the incubation period is short, and an infected person may die within 12 to 24 hours.

symptoms of the plague include fever, chills, painful and inflamed lymph nodes, or shortness of breath with coughing and/or blood-tainted sputum arise. it is important to seek medical attention immediately if any of these arise, jasarevic said.

mufleh came to the united states when she was 18 years old to attend college. ""i've always felt like an outsider, and i could identify with them,"" she said.

a few days later, she returned to the apartment complex—this time with a soccer ball. the experience led her to form her first soccer team for refugee boys.

""with a sharpie, everybody wrote their numbers and their names and wrote fugees on it. that was our first uniform,"" she said.

but mufleh soon realized that what these kids needed went beyond the soccer field. she found herself helping the kids with their homework.

mufleh created the fugees family , a nonprofit organization, and then opened a privately funded school for refugees called the fugees academy in 2007.

""when this started, i was a little overwhelmed. i was like, 'how am i going to do this?' i'm not a principal. i'm not an educator, but i am a coach,"" she said. ""i'm good at building teams, and i'm good at getting groups of people to work together and find a goal that we all want to reach.""

she reached her goal and turned the school into reality.

""typically our students have been in this country less than three or four months when they first come in. most of them have fled war and unimaginable horrors. they've never been in a school before. they've been in refugee camps,"" she said.

the academy has small class sizes so the students can get more individualized attention and learn the fundamentals of reading, writing and math.

""we have kids that come here who can't read when they enter school. and in four years, they are handing in five-page essays that are very well written,"" she said.

the students come from various countries including sudan, iraq and afghanistan.

""on paper they should be failing. they have every excuse to fail. they come from a foreign country, they've had no formal education, they live in poverty and their parents are illiterate,"" she said. ""that is a statistic for a kid who will never complete high school. and these kids are going to complete high school.""

the academy has close to 80 students, who are enrolled in grades six through 12. in addition to after-school tutoring, the fugees family also includes soccer programs for boys and girls ages 10 to 18 and an academic summer camp.

""i love seeing the kids come alive,"" she said. ""teachers always talk about the light in a kid's eye. and the most heartbreaking part is when that light is no longer there. and i don't get to see that. i get to see that light on every single day, and i love it.""

fartun hassan, a former student at the academy, said she liked the school because the classes were small. for her, mufleh was more than a coach and a teacher. ""she is like a mother to us,"" she said.

despite the success her students have achieved, mufleh said she can't always protect them from the prejudice that exists in the world. since the terrorist attacks in paris and san bernardino, she has witnessed some anti-refugee sentiment toward her students.

in a recent appeal letter to fugees family supporters, mufleh expressed her concern. ""i try to protect my kids when i can; i don't want them to see any more hatred and ignorance than what they have already experienced,"" she wrote.

fermentation of sugar to lactic acid produces about 15 times less energy than respiration of sugar, thevelein noted.
even though the researchers pinpointed some similarities between yeast and human cancer cells, ligibel explained, ""it's important to recognize we're a few steps away from even human cancer cells in a test tube.""
""when we think about the relationship between sugar and cancer -- when we think about what drives the level of sugar in someone's body -- it's primarily related to their weight,"" ligibel said.
sugar can cause obesity which leads to cancerasked whether he believes that eating more sugar leads to more cancer, thevelein immediately answered, ""no! THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Charlotte","a biologic mechanism in yeast cells may explain the relationship between sugar and malignant tumors, according to a recent study published in the journal nature communications.

the nine-year research project may even influence personal medicine and diets for cancer patients, the authors concluded. the study begins by looking closely at cancer cells' appetite for sugar.

scientists understand that cancer cells support their rapid reproduction by rewiring their metabolisms to take glucose, ferment it and produce lactate.

conversely, healthy cells continue with normal respiration, a process in which they take glucose and break it down into carbon dioxide and water.

this ""switch of cancer cells from respiration to fermentation is something that was discovered by otto warburg, a german biochemist, about 70 or 80 years ago,"" said microbiologist johan m. thevelein, senior author of the study and a professor at ku leuven in belgium. it is known as "" the warburg effect .""

fermentation of sugar to lactic acid produces about 15 times less energy than respiration of sugar, thevelein noted. yet cancer cells ""grow much more rapidly than normal cells, and yeast actually grows the fastest when they ferment,"" he noted.

""this is weird,"" he said, and it raises an important question: is the warburg effect a symptom of cancer -- or a cause of it?

searching for the answer, thevelein and his colleagues experimented with yeast cells since, just like cancer cells, they are known to favor fermentation over respiration.

the researchers found an intermediate compound that is a ""potent activator"" of the ras protein. ras is a proto-oncogene: a gene that codes for proteins that help to regulate cell growth and differentiation. proto-oncogenes can become oncogenes or cancer-causing genes when mutations occur. mutant forms of ras proteins are present in many tumors, thevelein said.

the new study, then, reveals ""a vicious cycle,"" he said.

as sugar is broken down in cells, the intermediate compound activates the ras proteins, and this in turn stimulates cell proliferation, he said.

this cycle seen in yeast cells might help explain the aggressiveness of cancer.

""very interesting,"" said dr. jennifer ligibel, chairwoman of the american society of clinical oncology's energy balance committee . still, she urges caution in interpreting these findings.

""it's important to not make too many jumps into a patient message based on a study of yeast,"" she said.

eating sugar or too much weight?

even though the researchers pinpointed some similarities between yeast and human cancer cells, ligibel explained, ""it's important to recognize we're a few steps away from even human cancer cells in a test tube.""

the study showed only an increased rate of cell growth triggered by glucose, she said. even though the team showed ras pathways being activated, this ""actually didn't result in the cells replicating more quickly,"" she said.

still, the data are ""incredible,"" said ligibel, who is also an associate professor of medicine at harvard medical school. ""this is really one of the first studies that's provided a biologic mechanism that could explain a relationship between glucose itself and cancer progression.

""when we think about the relationship between sugar and cancer -- when we think about what drives the level of sugar in someone's body -- it's primarily related to their weight,"" ligibel said.

when people are heavier, their bodies manage sugar differently than those of people who are lighter. this sugar management is what leads to type 2 diabetes, a disease in which blood sugar is high and levels of insulin, the hormone the body uses to manage blood sugar, begins to rise because the body becomes resistant to its effects.

""we've known for a while that having a higher blood sugar and having a higher level of insulin in your system are both linked to the risk of developing cancer,"" ligibel said.

at the same time, studies that have tried to look at how eating sugar might be linked to cancer risk ""have been much less consistent,"" she said. one large study of older us adults, for instance, did not find a relationship between the amount of sugar people ate and the risk of developing cancer.

conversely, she noted, other studies show that people diagnosed with colon cancer who ate a higher proportion of their total calories in sugar had a higher risk of cancer recurrence -- but only for people who were already overweight and obese. once again, how the body manages sugar -- and not the sweetener itself -- may be key.

studies in breast cancer patients have compared low-carbohydrate diets to low-fat diets and found that the amount of weight people lost, not the diet itself, was important, ligibel said. if it led to weight loss, either diet brought an identical lowering of sugar in the blood stream and an identical lowering of insulin.

""whether you achieved that through one diet versus another didn't seem to be as important as the amount of weight you lost if you were overweight or obese,"" she said. translated into practical advice for cancer patients: ""if you have someone who is obese or overweight, helping them to lose weight is going to be an important thing. we know that from a lot of different lines of study.

""i think that sugar definitely contributes to weight gain. i think that sugar doesn't have a lot of nutritional value,"" ligibel said. still, cancer patients need to focus on maintaining a healthy weight by balancing exercise and the food they eat.

sugar can cause obesity which leads to cancer

asked whether he believes that eating more sugar leads to more cancer, thevelein immediately answered, ""no! definitely not."" he and his co-authors do not state that in the paper; instead, they explain how normal, healthy cells can handle sugar in a controlled way.

""on the other hand, we all know that when you eat a lot of sugar, you have a tendency -- that has been clearly shown -- to become more obese,"" thevelein said. ""and obesity is linked to a higher risk of cancer.""

though it's ""too early to say,"" thevelein said that when you eat too much sugar over a long time, ""maybe this can also lead in some way to dysregulation of the ras protein in the normal cells,"" and possibly it is this ""dysregulation"" that triggers ras genes into becoming mutants.

""it's better not to eat too much sugar so that you don't become obese,"" he said. ""and if at the same time, you also decrease your risk of cancer, the better -- but this is something we cannot make a statement about at this moment.""

if anything, he would suggest that cancer patients eat less simple sugars and more complex sugars, such as those found in starch and whole grains. complex sugars are released more slowly and are taken up by the body more slowly, and this might be helpful to cancer patients.

""that would be our message,"" thevelein said: ""try to look for alternative ways of providing sugar and energy to cancer patients rather than rapidly metabolized simple sugars."" THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Charlotte",is there a link between sugar and cancer?

THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Fort Worth","new delhi (cnn) the delhi government is being urged to declare a city-wide health emergency, as residents endured a third straight day of heavy pollution.

air quality readings in india's capital have soared since tuesday, with one monitor showing levels in the city were 969 -- the world health organization considers anything above 25 to be unsafe

those levels are based on the concentration of fine particulate matter, or pm 2.5, per cubic meter. the microscopic particles, which are smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, are considered particularly harmful because they are small enough to lodge deep into the lungs and pass into other organs, causing serious health risks.

commuters in the indian capital make their way across the city amid heavy smog, november 7, 2017.

officials scrambled to provide a response as tv stations looped video of reporters taking live pollution readings amid a background of thick smog. on the street, residents tied scarfs across their faces as makeshift masks.

on wednesday, the delhi government took the unusual step of closing all schools until sunday , but has so far resisted calls from the indian medical association to declare a public health emergency, and enact more sweeping measures, such as temporarily banning cars from the roads.

the smog has blanketed much of the city in recent days, severely reducing visibility, restricting traffic and delaying flights. mahesh sharma, a government minister in the ministry of environment, forest and climate change, has blamed the unusually high pollution levels on a lack of wind and change in humidity levels.

among the world's most polluted cities

every winter, pollution levels in delhi and its neighboring cities rise.

delhi was named the most polluted city in the world in 2014 according to the who . since then, other indian cities have climbed up the list, knocking delhi's ranking down to 14.

""delhi has become a gas chamber. every year this happens during this part of year,"" arvind kejriwal, delhi's chief minister, tweeted. ""we have to find a solution to crop burning in adjoining states.""

delhi has become a gas chamber. every year this happens during this part of year. we have to find a soln to crop burning in adjoining states — arvind kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal) november 7, 2017

politicians and officials blame farmers in neighboring northern indian states who clear their fields by burning their crops. the landlocked capital sits in a natural bowl and is surrounded by industrial and agricultural hubs. without the coastal breeze of cities such as mumbai and chennai, much of the pollution settles.

every year, farmers across fertile neighboring states set fire to their fields to clear them for the next season. known as stubble burning, millions of tons of crop residue are set alight releasing untold amounts of particulate matter into the environment.

in addition to the crop burning, delhi's pollution comes from industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust from cars, road dust and burning of biomass, said santosh harish, assistant director of research at epic india, a research institute based in the us and india.

a report by the indian institute of technology kanpur carried out in 2014 found that vehicle omissions accounted for 20% of delhi's annual pm2.5 levels.

nevertheless, the number of cars on the city's roads has continued to rise . according to government statistics, the total number of vehicles in delhi exceeded 10 million for the first time in 2016.

in the wider delhi-national capital region (ncr) -- a sprawling area that encompasses delhi, as well as satellite districts in the neighboring states of haryana, uttar pradesh and rajasthan, and is home to some 46 million people -- a lack of effective public transportation has meant that workers are forced to drive to and from jobs in the city, further exacerbating the problem.

indian schoolchildren cover their faces as they walk to school, november 8, 2017. delhi has since mandated the closure of all schools until the pollution clears.

government inaction

in a bid to improve air quality, local governments have implemented various measures, including the shut down of power plants and brick kilns in the wider delhi region, as well as the banning of private electricity generators during the winter months, said anumita roychowdhury, executive director at the center for science and environment.

the country's supreme court also banned the sale of firecrackers during diwali -- the indian festival of lights.

still, there is much more work to be done to enact systematic change and not only emergency measures, said roychowdhury. one of the missing pieces is sustained public pressure.

""what we're unable to do as a community-at-large, and that also holds true for the government, is we've been unable to sustain interest beyond the three months of winter,"" said harish.

unlike in other notoriously smoggy cities such as beijing, air pollution has yet to become a politically sensitive issue in delhi. instead residents are increasingly looking to privatized solutions , claims govindraj ethiraj, the founder of data journalism site indiaspend.

""for instance, most people don't trust the quality of water that's supplied to their homes, so the solution that they found is the water purifiers,"" he said. ""so now what people have done is buy air purifiers.""

while air purifier and pollution mask sales have grown steadily, ethiraj points out it excludes the millions unable to afford the various high-tech solutions.

on the street wednesday, delhi resident mukesh kumar srivastav, whose job as a security guard requires that he stands outside for much of the day, said that air filtration was a distant dream.

petrossian -- the third generation to work in the luxury business founded by his grandfather in paris almost 100 years ago -- is here to guide the uninitiated through the fascinating process of selecting and eating the finest caviar.

though the delicacy of russian royalty still ranks among the most expensive foods in the world, costing up to hundreds of dollars for a tiny bite, petrossian is anything but pretentious.

instead, he's unabashedly passionate when sharing his love of sturgeon roe and introducing others to it.

""it's often the case that people are afraid of trying caviar for the first time,"" he says. ""they don't want to invest their life savings. but there are ways you can enjoy caviar without breaking the bank.""

work your way up

top grade caviar is usually lighter in color. petrossian

petrossian advises novices to ""come with a learning attitude"" and ""to educate"" their palates, which he compares to the journey of becoming a wine connoisseur.

""don't buy too high a grade at first, it's not necessary,"" he says.

""start with the lower grade and work your way up.""

top grade caviar is usually more mature and lighter in color. he suggests first-time buyers try tranmontanus caviar from california, which costs about $50 for one serving.

though caspian sea beluga is a name usually associated with caviar, overfishing endangered wild sturgeon so importing it became illegal in 2005.

luckily, farm-raised tranmontanus is somewhat affordable, ""easy to enjoy and you'll have the total experience of delicious caviar,"" says petrossian.

after trying this ""mercedes of caviar,"" you can proceed to ""the rolls-royce and the maybach.""

don't buy it till you've tried it

""try the caviar you're going to buy, that is key,"" as taste can vary from tin to tin, he says.

and a buyer should always be wary, petrossian cautions, as sometimes caviar is a ""fishy business -- i mean that without being funny.""

a few shady distributors purposely mislabel tins, akin to putting a chanel tag on a knock-off purse.

petrossian suggests always examining the cites (convention on international trade in endangered species) number that's on better tins.

this international organization, which regulates wild game, names the actual fish the caviar came from.

keep it cold

once you purchase your caviar, there's about a six-week window to enjoy it.

petrossian stresses that temperature is key.

""put it in the deepest and coldest part of your fridge, usually where you store vegetables,"" he says.

""open the tin at the last minute and then put it on crushed ice.""

hold the silver, but not the vodka

when it comes to spoons, avoid silver, says petrossian. andrey smirnov/afp/afp/getty images

now the tricky part, how exactly do you eat caviar?

first, you'll want to ""feel comfortable around these little fish eggs,"" says petrossian.

so relax, this is a treat to savor.

second, you need a spoon made out of a neutral material like wood or bone as silver reacts with the fish eggs.

put about a half teaspoon in your mouth and ""crush the little eggs with your tongue on your palate. just mix the oil,"" says petrossian.

for the purest experience, he likes to eat caviar ""straight out of the tin"" -- you can add toast points and creme fraiche as your taste develops.

your first bite of caviar should dazzle, bursting in your mouth with a satisfyingly rich, perfectly salty, exotic flavor.

to dry the palate before the next delicious taste, petrossian recommends either traditional vodka or champagne as ""the bubbles remove oils on the tongue.""

it's a matter of taste, not price

forget cost. it's all about sharing the caviar experience with someone special, says petrossian. petrossian

sitting in his restaurant, petrossian tries ""one of the better caviars""-- a special reserve alverta that runs just over $200 per serving. he takes a bite and, even after a lifetime in the business, his eyes sparkle.

""my god, it's delicious,"" he says.

""the eggs are huge and firm. it's deep without being too strong. the flavor is robust. you feel it on your tongue for a long time.""

despite his reaction, petrossian says ""there is no actual best caviar.""

""there is the most expensive because it's the rarest,"" he says.

""it can be the best to you. or the best to you can be the cheapest. it's all a matter of taste. and all tastes are different.""

what matters is that when you do find your perfect tin of caviar, you are also buying the inevitable special memories that come with it, says petrossian.

""whoever you share caviar with makes the experience even better,"" he says.

one of his favorite memories was when his son tried the delicacy for the first time -- at 18 months old.

a report released this week from the national association of city transportation officials, a nonprofit representing cities on transportation issues, lays out a vision for the future of city streets as autonomous vehicles arrive. some cities look to nacto for recommendations, but it's unclear if cities will adopt its guidance.

the blueprint suggests generally limiting self-driving vehicles to 20 mph and allowing pedestrians to cross streets anywhere, rather than only at intersection crosswalks. the speed restriction would be a noticeable decline in top speeds in many cities. this may extend trip times in vehicles.

the technology in self-driving cars will be able to identify when a person is trying to cross a street, and slow down. this could impact the concept of jaywalking.

""the instinctive human act of walking straight to one's destination, pejoratively known as 'jaywalking,' becomes simply 'walking,'"" write the authors.

the organization sees the adoption of autonomous vehicles as a chance to rethink how streets function. under its plan, the big benefactors are those most vulnerable on roads: pedestrians and bicyclists.

when pedestrians want to cross a street, it's not uncommon for them to walk several hundred feet out of their way. this wasn't always the case. a century ago, when cars first emerged, crossing a street mid-block was normal.

related: how free self-driving rides could change everything

in 1920, the term ""jaywalker"" was controversial, according peter d. norton, author of ""in fighting traffic: the dawn of the motor age in the american city."" it was popularized as a putdown for someone who didn't know how to walk properly in a city. in some cases, boy scouts handed out cards to jaywalkers, alerting them of their risky behavior.

in 1925, a law passed in los angeles making the move illegal and police arrested some offenders.

jaywalking is still generally illegal, but not the rule is often not enforced. if streets are occupied by self-driving cars in the future, perhaps the biggest shift in city culture, according to nacto, would be how easy it would be to cross streets.

but the report warns that the future could also play out differently, depending on city and government policies. traffic and emissions could skyrocket, and pedestrians could be forced to cross streets on bridges. current transportation systems could also be replaced by new services that aren't as affordable or accessible.

the self-driving coalition for safer streets -- which represents self-driving vehicle companies such as ford, uber, waymo and volvo -- said in a statement responding to the report that autonomous vehicles should be able to follow the rules of the road, such as speed limits. individual self-driving car companies declined to comment.

experts believe self-driving vehicles will significantly change city life, but many details are yet to be worked out. cities may find themselves weighing tradeoffs, choosing whether to prioritize vehicles, pedestrians and other uses of streets.

(cnn) there were scarcely any hints of the tumultuous years that would follow the swearing-in of dr. john pombe magufuli on 5th november 2015 as tanzania's fifth president. after all, his chama cha mapinduzi (ccm) party had been in power for decades, and his victory seemed to herald continuity with the past.

in fact, magufuli's opponent attracted more attention during the campaign than magufuli himself. when edward lowassa defected from ccm to the opposition and ran for president against his old party, it looked fleetingly as though this elite split might spell the end of ccm's dominance

but magufuli has not brought continuity, but dramatic change. he began to impress just days after his inauguration. he made a snap unannounced visit to the ministry of finance on his first day as president. then he pulled funds intended for independence day celebrations and redirected them to anti-cholera operations. he began a shake-up of the tanzania port authority, and extended it to the tanzania revenue authority as he launched a tax collection drive. an audit of the public payroll led to a purge of "" ghost workers "". quickly, it became apparent that he was genuinely waging war on corruption in the tanzanian state.

the primary victims of these anti-corruption operations have been mid- and low-ranking civil servants. however, magufuli has taken on high elites in ccm selectively too. in may, he fired minister of energy and minerals sospeter muhongo. this june, businessman james rugemalira and harbinder singh sethi found themselves in court , facing government prosecutors in court. both were linked to a major corruption case, the escrow scandal in 2014.

this thrift and intolerance for corruption won magufuli attention and admiration worldwide. in the social media sphere, commentators celebrated his zeal playfully with the hashtag, "" #whatwouldmagufulido "".

but since early 2016, it has become apparent that magufuli is not just waging war on corruption -- he is also declaring war on democracy.

tanzanian president john magufuli delivers speech during the swearing in ceremony in dar es salaam, on november 5, 2015.

war on democracy

together, these constitute major infringements on the freedom of expression and the opposition's ability to communicate with voters.

in march this year he announced at a press conference that:

""media owners, let me tell you: 'be careful. watch it. if you think you have that kind of freedom — not to that extent'.""

in part, this repressive streak is a return to form. ccm has a long history of authoritarianism. it has ruled tanzanian uninterrupted since 1977, and its predecessor parties ruled tanganyika since 1961.

but there is a more immediate reason that magufuli is tightening the noose on the opposition. the opposition has never been so strong. in 2005, ccm's jakaya kikwete won the presidential election with an unassailable lead of 68% over the runner-up. by 2015, ccm's margin of victory had been shortened to 18%. for the first time in tanzania's history, the opposition is a force to be reckoned with.

the most plausible explanation for magufuli's authoritarian turn is that he is trying to minimize the possibility of an opposition victory in the future. equally, every time he advances the anti-corruption agenda, he makes more enemies who might defect to the opposition. by narrowing space for opposition, he reduces the risk of them doing so.

but magufuli is not only relying on repressive means to stay in power. he is also pursuing a program that revives his popularity.

tanzanian media outlets have been closed under magufuli's reign.

the magufuli way

the third and most recent theme in magufuli's presidency has been a confrontation with multinational mining companies.

the controversy was kick-started this is the alleged discovery that acacia mining has been under-reporting of mineral exports earlier this year. magufuli has argued that multinational mining companies have been stealing tanzania's resources for years.

based on these claims, the government charged acacia mining with fines and back-dated taxes amounting to $190 billion. magufuli even threatened to nationalize the mines. his strategy of brinkmanship worked. on october 19th, acacia's parent company barrick gold announced that it had reached an agreement with the tanzanian government. it promised to find ways to further process copper-gold ores in tanzania, instead of exporting them for smelting, and it made a number of pecuniary concessions.

there is a strategic thread that ties together magufuli's actions.

tanzania's fifth five year plan restores industrialization to the heart of government policy in a way unseen since the 1970s. domestic processing and tax revenue is central to that plan. so is government discipline, thrift and tax collection. the closure of political space keeps ccm in power to implement it, and suffocates internal opposition to his reforms.

president magufuli has threatened to nationalize tanzanian mines.

but the definitive feature of magufuli's first two years has been a talent for pursuing his programme of reform while pursuing domestic popularity at the same time. his taste for the dramatic has caught public attention and his willingness to disturb the status quo has convinced many that his intentions are more sincere than those of his predecessors. perhaps more than any other president since tanzania's founding father, julius nyerere , magufuli is seen as a man of integrity.

while magufuli has skilfully coupled popular politics with fundamental reform, he has also precipitated a series of unintended changes which may be slipping beyond his control.

equally, by putting such pressure on the opposition, magufuli may make it stronger. attempts to divide the second opposition party, the civic united front, may drive them closer to chadema . they may also unintentionally make martyrs of the opposition. an attempted assassination attempt transformed opposition politician tundu lissu into a national hero.

it is not known who is behind the drive-by shooting that hospitalised lissu, in which at least 28 shots were fired, but lissu was among the most vocal opponents of the government . he was being tried in court for sedition just days before he was shot. no matter who was behind the attack, it is fast becoming the public image for the extremes of political change in tanzania under magufuli.

many underestimated magufuli at his inauguration two years ago, but few do now. while magufuli's election represents the continuation of ccm rule, he has brought about profound change. only time will tell whether the intended or the unintended consequences of his actions will be those that define his legacy.

police say tony mason jr. was on elgin ave. in a parked car with a woman, who sources say identified herself as his girlfriend, when a gunman approached them and opened fire.

she survived, but sources say she is terrified the killer will strike again.

nearby resident robert said he heard the gunfire from his window, and at least one of those shots hit and killed washington d.c. metropolitan police department sergeant tony mason jr.

“police was up and down the street for two or three hours or more,” robert said. “it sounded so loud. it was rapid three and then two. boom, boom, boom — boom, boom. like that.

mason was with a woman in a parked car when they were ambushed a block from gwynns falls parkway, not far from coppin state and mondawmin mall.

this happened just before 1 a.m. on saturday, and police aren’t saying much about the woman who was in the car with the sergeant. she survived after being shot in the leg.

mason’s cousin says he was a former marine, father of four, and he loved being a cop.

“it’s just hard to figure out why he would lose his life in this way,” said james grayton. “he lived in baltimore, and he commuted back and forth. that’s what he wanted to do.”

the killing came during a ceasefire in baltimore, with activists urging people to put down the guns.

it’s now the third year in a row that more than 300 people have died on baltimore’s streets.

last week, the mayor said stopping the killings is a priority.

“it’s like having an emergency plan. you can’t tell everybody all of the plans, but i can tell you we’re intensely focused on reducing violence in this city,” mayor catherine pugh said. “and that there are meetings going on every day around violence reduction.”

the number of murders in baltimore has surpassed much larger cities, like new york and philadelphia, that have yet to hit 300 this year.

“and i think we’re about to make a record here. i guess everybody is carrying guns,” robert said.

THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Fort Worth","frida ghitis, a former cnn producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. she is a frequent opinion contributor to cnn and the washington post and a columnist for world politics review. the opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.

(cnn) saudi arabia's prince mohammed bin salman, first in line to inherit the throne from his 81-year-old father, is not a patient man. the 32-year-old is driving a frenetic pace of change in pursuit of three goals: securing his hold on power, transforming saudi arabia into a very different country, and pushing back against iran.

in the two years since his father ascended the throne, this favorite son of king salman bin abdulaziz has been spectacularly successful at achieving the first item on his agenda. he has become so powerful so fast that observers can hardly believe how brazenly he is dismantling the old sedate system of family consensus, shared privilege and rigid ultraconservatism.

in the process, however, mbs, as the crown prince is known, is making a lot of enemies.

to put it in poker terms, the prince is, quite plainly, all in. he will either sweep the table, winning it all and becoming the all-powerful, transformative ruler of the desert kingdom, or fail spectacularly, with unforeseeable consequences for the region.

much of the prince's agenda is laudable and long overdue. he has no interest in democratic reforms, but he does want to introduce social reforms, and is making some progress on that front. that, too, is making him enemies among the old guard.

he has vowed to improve the status of women, announcing that the ban on women driving will be lifted next year, and limiting the scope of the execrable "" guardianship "" system, which treats women like children, requiring permission from male guardians for basic activities. he has also restrained the despised religious police. and just last month he called for a return to a ""moderate islam open to the world and all religions,"" combating extremism and empowering its citizens.

on the economic front, bin salman wants to reinvent an economy that became complacent from fantastic oil riches -- only to see oil prices crash -- and bring it into the 21st century with his ambitious vision 2030 plan.

but the prince's revolutionary changes require, above all, making sure he remains in charge, and he is letting nothing stand in his way.

the prince is not bluffing. that became startlingly clear last sunday, when he unexpectedly ordered the arrest of some of saudi arabia's most powerful men.

in what some are calling the night of the long knives -- an unflattering comparison to a 1934 purge in germany -- authorities detained princes and ministers who had, moments before, wielded great influence and lived in luxury. the fact that their temporary prison is riyadh's lavish ritz-carlton hotel, (the gilded home for donald trump during his recent visit) makes their situation no less perilous or humiliating.

the government says the wave of arrests, which by some accounts numbers as many as 500 , was part of a new anti-corruption campaign. king salman has just made mbs chair of a new supreme committee on corruption, with the power to "" take any precautionary measures "" against corruption, including arrest and seizure of assets.

the new position gives bin salman even more power in addition to his role as heir to the throne, minister of defense, president of the council for economic development, and others.

saudi arabia is riddled with corruption -- that is no secret. and it's true that mbs' economic reform program, which calls for diversifying the economy and attracting foreign investment, would greatly benefit if corruption were uprooted. but no impartial observer would believe this was all about corruption. by all appearances, the principal objective was fortifying bin salman's hold on power. in fact, the arrests of prominent businessmen and the possible confiscation of their wealth is more likely to spook foreign investors than to make them risk their money in the new saudi arabia.

outside the kingdom, the most famous detainee is prince alwaleed bin talal, one of the world's wealthiest men. he had, interestingly, disparaged trump on social media in 2015. he is one of the dozens purged, which include numerous ministers and deputy ministers, top advisers and business personalities, many now crammed into a ballroom at the ritz-carlton. among those purged is a top economic adviser to the crown prince, the commander of the saudi navy, the former governor of riyadh, and many others who are well known and well connected.

it's hard to imagine that their public humiliation will not produce a reaction in the tight-knit kingdom.

also removed from power was the minister of the national guard, prince mutaib bin abdullah, son of the previous king. the move is striking because it takes the 100,000-man national guard from the family of the late king abdullah.

mbs' rise dismantled the division of power among saudi brothers and cousins. when he became crown prince in june , he removed the previous heir to the throne, prince mohammed bin nayef, who in turn had taken the place of prince muqrin , who was removed from the succession in 2015, when king salman took power.

in a mysterious development that occurred almost simultaneously with the wave of arrests, the son of the former crown prince, prince mansour bin muqrin, died in an aircraft crash on sunday, adding to the sense that there's much more happening in saudi arabia than meets the eye.

the stakes, to be sure, could not be higher for a kingdom unaccustomed to change.

perhaps king salman is preparing to step down, and his son is pushing away against potential challengers.

as the prince moves forward aggressively to secure power, he is also pushing just as hard toward other goals. his campaign against iran and its hezbollah allies in lebanon is heating up and he is avidly luring investors

but of his three priorities, it is only the first, strengthening his grip, on which he is making measurable progress. the economy has not started reviving; on foreign policy, his war against iran's allies in yemen looks like a quagmire. iran continues to gain ground, and a blockade of qatar has not succeeded in breaking doha's ties to iran. mbs' main foreign policy success so far is gaining the backing of president trump

because of this, and some particularities of texas gun laws, kelley was able to purchase the rifle he used in the shooting from a sporting goods store in san antonio in april 2016.

here's a closer look at the laws surrounding owning and carrying a gun in texas.

texas has no assault weapons legislation

like most states, texas does not have an assault weapons ban in place. after the federal assault weapons ban expired in 2004, only seven states and the district of columbia instated assault weapons bans , and two other states have regulations but not bans.

you need a license to carry a handgun on you, but not a long gun

in texas, you do not need a permit to buy a handgun or a long gun . you also are not required to register firearms with the state, and you are not required to be licensed as an owner.

texas has a very specific set of regulations on who can and cannot be licensed to carry a handgun.

according to the texas department of public safety, a person can be rendered ineligible for several reasons, including the conviction of a felony or class a or class b misdemeanor ""or equivalent offense.""

according to abbott, the texas department of public safety indicated kelley applied for, and was denied, a license to carry a handgun . however, according to state laws , just because you do not have a license to carry a handgun does not mean you can't purchase or possess one under federal law.

kelley bought four weapons in total -- two in colorado and two in texas, the atf said. one each was purchased in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. two handguns were found in the shooter's vehicle. a ruger ar-556 rifle was found in front of the church where kelley dropped it when a local resident rushed him.

while handgun licenses are a regulated part of texas law, you do not need a license to carry a long gun, the gun that kelley fired into the church. moreover, there is no provision in the texas penal code that prohibits carrying a long gun in public.

you do need to pass a background check

there is no waiting period for purchasing firearms in texas, but you do need to pass a background check. in some states, a background check can be run fairly quickly through the national instant criminal background check system (nics). however, texas is not one of these states, so firearms dealers are required to contact the fbi directly for all firearm background checks

the gun control act prohibits the ""transfer of a firearm"" (which can be a sale) to people with certain criminal or personal history. among the things that can keep you from getting a gun: a conviction of a crime ""punishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year,"" restraining orders pertaining to ""an intimate partner or child,"" a conviction of a ""misdemeanor crime of domestic violence,"" or a dishonorable discharge from the us armed forces.

this brings us back to the air force's failure to notify civilian law enforcement of kelley's criminal record.

this article states that anyone who ""who attempts or offers with unlawful force or violence to do bodily harm to another person"" is guilty of assault, and any person who ""commits and assault"" resulting or likely to result in death or serious injury is guilty of aggravated assault.

a us air force spokeswoman told cnn kelley was punished under these provisions and received a "" bad conduct discharge ."" this discharge is different than a ""dishonorable discharge,"" which would have immediately prevented him from being sold a weapon under the gun control act.

however, somehow the seriousness of the convictions never got relayed.

the air force acknowledged monday evening that it did not appropriately relay kelley's court martial conviction for domestic assault to civilian law enforcement, preventing it from appearing in the federal database that licensed gun dealers are required to check before selling someone a firearm.

""had his information been in the database, it should have prevented gun sales to kelley,"" the air force said.

in the statement, the air force says the air force inspector general is currently conducting an investigation into what happened.

""somebody really dropped the ball,"" former air force chief prosecutor colonel don christensen told cnn.

the photo, two cupped hands holding a tiny male fetus, appeared on screen as dramatic music played. against this backdrop, a medical technician detailed how she was present when an intact 19-week gestated fetus was aborted at a planned parenthood clinic and, she says, harvested for tissue samples.

daleiden's video failed to mention that the photo and the story do not match.

abortion photo actually stillborn child

the photo was not an aborted fetus at a planned parenthood clinic. it was the stillborn child of alexis fretz, whose son was stillborn in 2013. fretz took the photo and posted it on the internet to memorialize the son she named walter.

cnn investigations email your story ideas and tips to cnntips@cnn.com.

without fretz's knowledge, daleiden and his two-man documentary group called the center for medical progress plucked that photo from her web page and dropped it into his anti-planned parenthood documentary.

""was it clear?"" fretz asks herself in a cnn interview, ""no it was not clear. was it deceitful? i don't know that.""

daleiden told cnn the fact that the photo is not an actual photo of an aborted fetus makes no difference. he insists the fetus is the same age as the one referred to in his film, and he used it only as an illustration.

misleading video cited in republican debate

daleiden also is being criticized for a second, potentially misleading use of video that has found its way into the republican presidential campaign. gop candidate carly fiorina cited a portion of the center for medical progress videos in which an intact fetus kicks its left leg and moves an arm shortly after being aborted.

fiorina described the video during cnn's republican debate at the ronald reagan presidential library on september 16, using the horrific image in her call for an end to federal funding for planned parenthood.

in an interview in southern california earlier this month, daleiden now admits he has no information on where the video was actually taken. there is no evidence it was taken at a planned parenthood clinic.

daleiden says the image came from an outside source, an anti-abortion group called the center for bioethical reform and he doesn't know its origin beyond that. a spokesman for the group tells cnn it won't disclose the location either, only that the video in question was paid for. despite its source, daleiden again insists the video is only used as an illustration of what an intact aborted fetus would look like, not the actual fetus referred to in his film.

critics call videos heavily edited, discredited

the two examples of misleading pictures and video have allowed planned parenthood and its supporters to label the center for medical progress's entire production a fraud.

dawn laguens, an executive vice president with planned parenthood, repeated the defense the women's health group and its many supporters have been trying to convey since the first of the center for medical progress's nine videos began to be released online.

""all of the tapes and footage david daleiden has released out into the world has been heavily edited,"" laguens told cnn. ""and i think pretty thoroughly discredited.""

daleiden insists the two uses of video and photos are not misleading, and says the entire controversy has been manufactured by planned parenthood and its ""allies in the mainstream media"" in order to divert attention from the main point of his documentary: that planned parenthood uses aborted fetal tissue as a revenue source.

planned parenthood ends payments

the center for medical progress spent several years taping planned parenthood employees, medical directors and some of its affiliate partners discussing the technique, costs and reimbursement payments for the harvesting of fetal tissue samples for scientific research.

the filming was done without knowledge of those speaking. in several instances, cmp argues that planned parenthood representatives appear to be bargaining, negotiating and detailing the best ways to collect or ""harvest"" aborted fetuses for maximum financial gain.

in one episode, dr. mary gatter, a medical director for planed parenthood, is filmed during a meal discussing her proposal that each tissue sample harvested should fetch a $75 charge.

since selling fetal tissue samples is illegal, planned parenthood has been quick to label the transactions as reimbursement costs and that they were made only at a tiny fraction of the organization's 700 clinics and affiliates. planned parenthood executives continue to claim the videos are heavily edited, taken out of context and deceptive.

but last week planned parenthood announced it would no longer accept any reimbursement costs at any of its clinics for the transfer of fetal tissue-samples. in a letter to the national institutes of health, planned parenthood's president defended her organization and insisted all transactions in the past were legal. but says the new change in policy was being taken ""...in order to take away any basis for attacking planned parenthood to advance an anti-abortion political agenda.""

we will soon find out, as new jersey and virginia hold races for local and state offices including governor. in the virginia governor's race, the republican nominee ed gillespie has aired a series of television ads evoking images of salvadoran immigrant gang members and has accused his democratic rival of being soft on crime.

this week, we are seeing reports of a local mailer in edison, new jersey, sent by an unidentified person or group, targeting two local school board candidates with a post card that reads , ""the chinese and indians are taking over our town!""

these tactics should shock the conscience of all americans, and forebode a dark series of congressional and statewide campaigns in 2018 if they are successful.

these race-baiting strategies in virginia and new jersey are not entirely new. gillespie's ads featuring salvadoran gang members are eerily reminiscent of the 1988 willie horton ad that helped to sink the presidential candidacy of michael dukakis. and racial incidents against asian-americans in new jersey date back to the ""dotbuster"" attacks against indian immigrants in the 1980s and local crackdowns on karaoke bars in the 1990s.

what is new, however, is that donald trump's victory in 2016 is triggering a new wave of copycat tactics at the state and local level, using racial bullhorns instead of dog whistles to win political office.

trump's victory last november surprised many republican officials, as he tore to shreds the republican national committee's growth and opportunity project . in the wake of mitt romney's stinging defeat in 2012, the gop report urged candidates to soften the party's image in order to woo latino and asian american voters.

it reminded party officials that their brand is one of ""tolerance and respect, and we need to ensure that the tone of our message is always reflective of these core principles."" on immigration, the rnc noted that ""we must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform. if we do not, our party's appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only.""

it wasn't just the party establishment calling for reform, even conservative commentators like sean hannity and bill o'reilly voiced their support for a pathway to citizenship.

trump opted for a completely different path to secure the presidential nomination and, ultimately, the presidency. far from choosing a welcoming message on immigration and a respectful tone toward hispanics, he kicked off his campaign with explicit racial appeals about rapists from mexico and continued with attacks on a hispanic judge's ethnic heritage.

he also called for a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states and said in a cnn interview that ""islam hates us,"" a far cry from president george w. bush's consistent statements that separated the peaceful teachings of islam from the views of violent extremists.

while far milder statements had failed in previous candidacies such as pat buchanan's campaign in 1992 and rudy giuliani's run in 2008, trump's candidacy suggested that republicans could win political office making racial appeals, not just implicitly but loudly and explicitly.

it is still not clear, however, if this kind of explicit racial strategy can be successful beyond the trump candidacy. trump was a dominant media personality and a well-known rule breaker and violator of taboos. voters could therefore be excused for overlooking his outrageous statements on immigrants and racial minorities and focusing on his purported ability to make good economic deals and vows to ""drain the swamp"" in washington, dc.

the same cannot be said for ed gillespie, who is the ultimate washington insider , far milder than trump, and much less well known. importantly, however, gillespie has lent his campaign's name to the ms-13 ad and has vociferously defended the ad on cable television. the willie horton ad, by contrast, was created by a political action committee independent of george h.w. bush, and the bush campaign distanced itself from the ad on the campaign trail and during televised debates.

gillespie is calculating that his racially controversial ads will ultimately help him, not hurt him. so, too, are the apparent backers of the racist mailers in new jersey, who are whipping up fears of immigrants and racial outsiders to help defeat local school board candidates.

the only way that these racial appeals will diminish is if they are rejected at the ballot box. otherwise, we can expect a far greater number of candidates, incumbents as well as challengers, working to add race-baiting advertisements and appeals to their 2018 campaigns.

a pilgrimage to the tech giants

from the facebook billboard to the google android sculptures to apple's one infinite loop sign, social media addicts, engineers, and tech geeks from around the world make daily pilgrimages to see, touch and interact with the tech brands changing life as we know it.

the world's first high-technology region is a suburban world of office parks that are mostly closed to the public, which comes as a surprise to some travelers.

at least nine bay area tour groups offer silicon valley tours, with the caveat that few offer any inside access. still, a friendly tour guide will give you the history of these famous tech companies and the area.

""at the pinnacle of car culture, tourists wanted to go to detroit. it's natural that in the information age, tourists would come to silicon valley,"" said historian randall stross, a silicon valley-based author and business professor at san jose state university.

""i don't understand the appeal of taking a selfie in front of a sign found on the campus of one of the iconic silicon valley companies,"" said stross. ""but i do understand the impulse to mark the visit in some way, and no better access is offered by the companies.""

that may be changing. apple recently let reporters inside its new visitor center, a floor-to-ceiling glass building that will have a cafe, store and viewing pavilion overlooking the new spaceship campus. it's scheduled to open later this fall.

if you're traveling on your own, here's where you can get a taste of ""the valley""'s tech companies and the tech-empowered local businesses capitalizing on the tech theme.

the tech giants: facebook

like chada's sister, fans of the social network get a kick out of posing in front of the ""like"" sign at the company's headquarters.

look on the back of the sign to see the old sign for sun microsystems, the once thriving computer systems company that used to own the campus.

there's no visitors center, public tours or gift shop. but during the warmer months, facebook holds several community festivals and a farmer's market on the main parking lot that are free to the public. and there are plans in five years to have an entire facebook village with a grocery store, pharmacy, houses and offices -- which will all be open to the public.

the tech giants: google

at the mountain view headquarters of google and its parent company, alphabet inc., sadly, you won't be able to see the free laundry rooms, swimming pools or cafeterias without an employee contact.

but visitors are encouraged to photograph the android sculpture garden, with more than a dozen whimsical homages to the google android mobile operating system names (cupcake, jelly bean, ice cream sandwich). though google's visitor center is limited to guests of employees, all are welcome at the google store nearby, where company t-shirts, stuffed android toys and other swag are for sale.

the tech giants: apple

across the street from apple park, the company's new 2.8-million-square-foot campus, the company has built a floor-to-ceiling glass visitor center scheduled to open in late 2017 . the building features an apple store with exclusive merchandise, a café, outdoor seating area and rooftop deck from which the public can get a good look at the new ""spaceship"" building. there's also a model of the new campus that visitors can explore with an augmented reality app.

for now, visitors to the current headquarters in cupertino can make do with a photo in front of the one infinite loop sign and a visit to the campus apple store, which carries exclusive collectibles to make your apple fan friends jealous, like retro t-shirts with the rainbow apple logo from the original macintosh.

one in three children who die in auto accidents aren't protected by seat belts or car seats, according to the american academy of pediatrics. since the implementation of laws and national awareness campaigns such as click it or ticket, deaths have plummeted. in children younger than a year, for example, the proper use of car seats has reduced deaths by 71%.

familiar with the back to sleep campaign to eliminate sudden infant death syndrome or sids, one of the leading causes of infant death? called safe to sleep today, it urges parents to put babies to sleep on their backs, never on the stomach, until age 1. since the start of the campaign in 1994, sids rates have dropped by half, which is why it was chosen by the american academy of pediatrics as one of the most important achievements in children's health in the past 40 years.

there are hundreds of high-tech gadgets on the market that promise to help new parents closely monitor their babies' health and well-being. often, they are no different than the fitbits or apple watches that adults wear, said dr. jennifer shu, pediatrician at children's medical group in atlanta.

""as far as wearable monitors for babies, that tends to be a little bit newer, and that may be some kind of monitor that has technology that's paired up with a base station that then transmits information to a parent's phone app,"" shu said.

""i recommend parents to follow their common sense. if it looks like something that could be safe that you want to try, then maybe talk it over with your pediatrician to see if they have any concerns,"" she said. ""but if it's something that looks like it could be uncomfortable or hard to use, you may want to steer away from it.""

wearables for wee ones

can the information that these nursery technologies provide really be beneficial, or could they just be causing new parents to excessively worry?

king thinks smart thermometers and wearables could be useful to new parents, who could customize the amount of notifications they receive from a baby-monitoring app or technology in order to minimize feeling overwhelmed.

technologies now available can help parents casually monitor a baby's heart rate, temperature, feedings and sleep cycle, but experts warn against using them for valuable medical information or diagnoses.

for instance, a pacifier thermometer can be a convenient way to casually check your baby's temperature at home, but for a medical emergency or when your child is sick, talk to your pediatrician about what's recommended.

""it could alert a parent that the pacifier temperature is a little elevated (and) that they may want to recheck it using a rectal thermometer or a temporal artery thermometer,"" shu said.

""one important thing to keep in mind is that fever in a baby younger than about 2 to 3 months of age is always something to take very seriously, and that's because fever in a very young infant can be a sign of a very significant infection that can spread through the body very quickly,"" she said. ""it's something that you definitely want to talk to your pediatrician about right away.""

additionally, the food and drug administration has not cleared or approved any baby technologies or products as being able to prevent or reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome , known as sids. some retail baby products have been marketed with false claims that they do, according to the fda.

an opinion published in the medical journal jama in january even noted that ""there is no evidence that consumer infant physiologic monitors are life-saving, and there is potential harm if parents choose to use them,"" such as due to overdiagnosis by using consumer monitors.

on the other hand, it could be useful for tech-savvy parents to share the data from their smart thermometers or wearable devices with their pediatricians.

""in this new era of apps and tracking data, all this technology could be helpful, just as it's helpful when a breastfeeding mom, for instance, shows me how well her baby's been feeding,"" shu said.

""i take that information and put that together with how the baby looks in their examination,"" she said. ""but it's not completely necessary, because we do look at the full big picture.""

king could see high-tech gadgets providing peace of mind at a time when parents already might have concerns about their child's health, she said. for instance, avery was born prematurely.

parents of premature babies often need to be extra vigilant about infants' feeding and sleep schedules.

most premature babies have eight to 10 feedings a day, according to the american academy of family physicians , and maintaining a regular feeding schedule can be stressful for a concerned parent.

just watched does this $1,200 crib make your newborn sleep? replay more videos ... must watch does this $1,200 crib make your newborn sleep? 02:11

for parents considering investing in such technologies, shu said they should be aware of potential safety hazards.

""safety hazards could be things like getting entangled from wires, for example, if there are wires or having something that is soft or a choking hazard or any kind of suffocation hazard that might be in a crib or bassinet with a baby,"" shu said.

""we really don't recommend that people depend on technology to take the place of common sense, and that means things like placing your baby on their back to go to sleep and having a bare crib. you don't want anything soft or fluffy in the crib with the baby, because those kinds of things can suffocate and cause problems like sids,"" she said. ""remember that products you buy are not a substitute for good adult supervision.""

it turns out that in the future, parents could use drones to supervise their children.

could drones replace baby monitors?

a team of scientists from the university of south australia recently designed and tested a drone that uses remote-sensing imaging systems to detect heart and respiratory rates in humans.

the researchers tested the drone on 15 healthy volunteers, including two children, 3 and 5 years old, said javaan chahl, a professor in the university of south australia's school of engineering and a co-author of the study.

the researchers found that the drone achieved robust and accurate readings from the volunteers. the findings were published in the journal biomedical engineering online in august.

""in other studies, we are exploring the idea of using this technique for infants. to date, we have captured data from quite a few infants, but all were in cots in their homes,"" chahl said.

""i would not be surprised if drones are eventually used to monitor many situations. they have an advantage of mobility that no ground robot can match, although their endurance is currently a bit limited,"" he said. ""as they become more intelligent, i expect that they will start to understand who and what they are looking at. for example, 'jasmine is skipping' or even 'jimmy and jia are chasing anand.' ""

""over there, we were just worried about water, survival, ammunition, food and god,"" todd said.

his job was to assist with trauma and injuries on the battlefield. in the end, it was todd who needed help.

he contracted bilateral atypical pneumonia, which is pneumonia in both lungs. he said he knew he was in trouble when he was wrapping up a blast site.

despite all this, he got back on his feet and started working again.

""i was there for another week, and then one of the battalion surgeons came up to me and said, 'doc, we've got to get you out of here.' ""

todd was ultimately sent to a hospital in germany.

""i could feel (the pneumonia) shutting my respiratory system down,"" he said. ""i was really close to dying.""

life after war

after he recovered and moved to atlanta, todd had a hard time adjusting to civilian life.

""i tell my friends all the time, i'd rather got shot because that's more heroic,"" he said. ""it's like now there's an asterisk on my deployment. it took me a long time to stand up from that.""

todd struggled with depression and anxiety and turned to alcohol to deal with the pain.

""i haven't been formally diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder,"" he said. ""there's a strong possibility that i have some level of it.""

eventually, todd received help from two doctors in atlanta. then he went back to school to study economics and public policy at georgia state university.

""i thought school was a really important part of my transition. i started building a career in wealth management.""

but after a client died, todd had a change of heart.

""i went to philadelphia for the funeral, and then we've buried so many friends to whether it be suicide, substance abuse, addiction,"" he said. ""i really just had enough.""

making music to help others

todd grew up freestyling and rapping in memphis, tennessee, and music was a big part of his life until he joined the navy.

""it was just time for me to be who i am,"" he said. ""and live the life that i was called to live.""

with savings from his job in wealth management and help from his wife, todd quit his job to focus on his true passion: music.

todd wants his hip-hop album to help other veterans with ptsd.

now he hopes to use his voice to help veterans heal. he wrote and performed the album ""combat medicine"" under the name doc todd.

""i was in combat medicine as my profession. the album itself is intended to be medicine for people who have served in combat,"" he said. ""it's about the transition and dealing with war ... and standing up and trying to get back on your feet again.""

the song ""not alone"" is aimed at veteran suicide.

""you don't have to isolate yourself. no matter what your story is or what you went through on deployment, there's somebody out there who has a similar story,"" he said. ""we're letting people know that there's people on the other side of this fight and that you can make it through.""

their ability to balance work with quality time with friends and family not only keeps their stress levels down, it gives them a happiness boost. studies show that people who focus on experiences versus things have higher levels of satisfaction long after the moment has passed. that’s one reason denmark takes the top spot as the happiest nation in the annual world happiness report commissioned by the united nations.

other things play into copenhagen's relaxed atmosphere. residents walk to restaurants and walk to get groceries. there are outdoor food markets with fresh produce and vegetables within a few blocks of most spots in the city.

men cycle to work in their slim-fit suits, and women don’t shy away from pairing a bike helmet with their sundresses and wedge heels. the city has 249 miles of bike paths, which makes biking an easy and safe option. and people use them: nearly half of commuters in copenhagen travel to work or school by bike each day.

though parks and bike paths are plentiful, the government is upping its efforts. by 2015, all residents must be able to reach a park or beach by foot in less than 15 minutes, according to a new official municipal policy. many of the new parks created will be “pocket parks,” or small green spaces for city residents. the hope is that they will help keep residents fit and help the environment by reducing traffic and pollution.

here’s one more stat that may make you want to start packing your bags for denmark: ninety-six percent of residents in copenhagen say they can count on someone if they are in need.

this supportive society is just another reason copenhagen earns a spot as one of the healthiest (and happiest) cities. THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for Indianapolis",the cnn 10: healthiest cities

(cnn) ""climate change is the canvas on which the history of the 21st century will be painted.""

that's mark lynas, writing in ""six degrees: our future on a hotter planet.""

it's a true if disturbing prediction.

by some accounts, we've already entered the anthropocene , an epoch defined by human degradation of the natural world. we're causing extinctions, changing the climate. mother nature is still powerful, sure. but, as lynas explains, we humans are so fundamental a force that we are changing the way she works.

i recently asked readers of my ""2 degrees"" newsletter ( sign up here ) to suggest ""must-read"" books on climate change -- and lynas' important work of nonfiction was among your top recommendations. i've been reading it, and i recently interviewed the author. the book takes a degree-by-degree look at the future of our planet as it continues to warm. two degrees of warming, which the international community is trying to avoid, and which is the focus of my climate change initiative at cnn, sounds bad. but, as lynas told me, a world that's 6 degrees warmer than before the industrial revolution, which is possible if we keep burning alarming amounts of fossil fuels and chopping down forests, sounds downright hellish.

11. ""climate changed,"" by philippe squarzoni

""it's an amazing book. it's an illustrated nonfiction book (graphic novel format) that is built on squarzoni's interviews with ipcc scientists. the science is well explained, but the power comes from watching squarzoni absorb the information and struggle to fit it into his life, just like a reader, over the six years it took him to put the book together. so the intangible social aspect of climate, which is probably more important to solutions than climate science itself, is explored with candor."" -- richard reiss, from new york

""i want to just say that president xi -- where we will be tomorrow, china -- has been very helpful. THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for New York","beijing (cnn) china's emboldened leader xi jinping offered donald trump a display meant to satisfy a leader susceptible to flattery when the us president touched down in beijing on wednesday.

but beneath the state pageantry lies another message, one not meant to stoke trump's ego but instead to issue a stark reminder. xi, now the most powerful chinese leader in decades, leads a nation that's poised to challenge the us in new and unpredictable ways.

how trump -- who is desperate to find success amid sagging approval ratings and an investigation into his campaign's ties to russia -- responds to xi's overtures could help dictate the world's most important bilateral relationship for years to come.

""as far as china is concerned, my relationship, as you know, with president xi is also excellent. i like him a lot. i consider him a friend. he considers me a friend,"" trump said earlier this week in japan, his first stop in asia. ""with that being said, he represents china; i represent the united states. his views are different on things.""

the breadth and scale of the issues up for discussion in beijing render the two-day stop, which begins wednesday, the most consequential foreign visit of trump's presidency. coming midway through the us president's tour through five asian capitals, his diplomacy in china acts as the fulcrum of a strategy for asia that hinges upon xi's cooperation on security and economic issues, which trump has framed as essential to both american and chinese success.

at the core is trump's insistence that beijing do more to isolate north korea amid its nuclear provocations, believing that pyongyang's chief trading partner has unparalleled power to choke off the regime. but the agenda also includes intensive talks on trade, a pet issue for a president intent on returning economic security to the american lower and middle classes.

to drive forward his economic message, trump will be joined by dozens of american business executives who are expected to announce billions of dollars in agreements, some of which have been in the works for years. the inking of the deals in china can help trump cast his visit as win, despite the lingering disputes and questions over the trading relationship.

global statesman?

in the lead-up to his visit, trump's aides spent a series of focused, hour-long sessions preparing him for the various topical conversations expected to arise during his talks with xi. but they also worked to coach him on the finer aspects of chinese official protocol, believing that a seamless visit could help bolster the sense that trump is an effective global statesman.

trump's brand of brash and opinionated politics is an awkward fit in china, where diplomacy is conducted according to strict protocols and off-hand comments have the potential to cause unintentional offense. some chinese officials have expressed concern at what trump may say in the country, and there's an acknowledgment that even china's ""great firewall"" that blocks numerous social media sites -- including twitter -- will have little impact on the president's ability to fire off messages.

""i think that what concerns them is the unpredictability that they see,"" said christopher johnson, a former china analyst for the cia who is now a senior adviser at the center for strategic and international studies in washington. ""typically the chinese, what they want most in the bilateral relationship is stability. they don't need to like the us president. they just need the person to be predictable.""

""i don't think they see that with president trump,"" johnson said.

in xi, trump finds a leader flexing newfound political muscle after emerging from china's communist party congress having consolidated power in historic fashion. american officials aren't yet sure precisely what to make of the developments, which xi could use to exert greater influence within china and possibly the wider region.

trump, who has record low approval ratings and is politically hamstrung by investigations into his ties to russia, has praised xi's new stature, comparing him to a king during an interview on fox business channel last week. but he's also downplayed the potential power mismatch. aboard air force one this week, he quickly interjected when a reporter referred to xi as politically powerful.

""excuse me, so am i,"" trump insisted, identifying a surging stock market and low unemployment as evidence.

in beijing, that view is likely to be validated by the outsized ""state visit-plus"" welcome planned by chinese officials. trump will be feted by military honor guards and dine at an elaborate state banquet. upon his arrival, xi will walk him through the forbidden city and provide a personal tour of a collection of chinese antiquities.

the welcome display is designed as much to flatter trump as it is to demonstrate xi's view of china as a global superpower, with both an ancient history and an increasingly modern society to call upon in his bid to compete with the united states. past administrations have worked to counter china's influence in asia through military alliances, trade agreements and soft-power programs like the peace corps.

trump, however, has expressed less urgency in slowing the inevitable rise of china. he has withdrawn the us from the trans-pacific partnership, the massive trade pact initiated by president barack obama to act as a counterbalance in asia to china's economic pull. he has expressed a desire to wean allies off american support, encouraging the purchase of us-made weapons systems that would allow nations like japan and south korea to defend themselves. and he's moved to slash the budgets of agencies like the state department, which execute the diplomatic efforts to spread american influence among china's neighbors.

those steps, paired with the sense that washington is gripped with intractable political gridlock, have led to the impression among some in the region that china is a better functioning power.

""there is a certain amount of sly happiness with what seems to be the decline of the united states. there's been a lot of commentary about dysfunction in american democracy, the impossibility of getting congressional agreement on basic things like having a budget and funding infrastructure,"" said david dollar, a former us treasury department envoy based in china who is now a senior fellow at the brookings institution. ""this works well for china. the us seems to be in decline and yet, you know he's a practical president with whom china can deal on specific issues.""

approach to china

trump's approach to china has been shaped both by his deeply felt opinion that unfair trade practices have badly harmed american workers and his view that the united states requires partners in combating threats to global security like north korea.

as a presidential candidate, it was the first viewpoint that often dominated, and helped him win over white working class voters who ultimately propelled him to the presidency. he accused beijing of raping the united states , vowed to label china a currency manipulator, and frankly declared the country an economic enemy.

it was a stance shaped partly by steve bannon, his onetime chief white house strategist and still an informal adviser who has pressed trump to adopt a far tougher stance in countering china's trade practices.

but others in his administration have voiced an alternate view, insisting that china's economic rise is an inevitability that requires partnership -- not war -- with the united states.

the dueling options have led to some confusion among some chinese officials on where, precisely, trump stands.

as trump himself has expressed divergent opinions on china, the impression that he's echoing the last person who advised him has lingered. that trump's son-in-law and top white house adviser jared kushner was, at one stage, undertaking diplomatic efforts outside the usual state department channels only fueled the impression that the trump administration was approaching china without a fully formed strategy.

in recent months, however, the administration's approach has narrowed. kushner has backed off on developing inroads to the chinese government, a result of a more streamlined west wing and questions over his family's real estate ties to chinese investors.

and trump has seen successes in convincing china to agree to new punitive measures against north korea, though the actual results of those moves has yet to truly materialize.

speaking in south korea on tuesday, trump praised xi for his help in isolating the nuclear menace and said the ramifications of those steps would soon be apparent.

""i want to just say that president xi -- where we will be tomorrow, china -- has been very helpful. we'll find out how helpful soon. but he really has been very, very helpful,"" he said. THIS IS A LOCAL NEWS for New York",all eyes on trump during high-stakes china visit
